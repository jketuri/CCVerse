Day by the dim
light
of his great journey had troubled so they had of the memories
that the king shall go gleaming
out of a fabulous light
that had had with man with the room was the bright
sun.
He could past your way that there would not quite
a light
mist on through their colours that might
be only knew that the chamber remained dim
where he walked behind his night
off the last star corner for the day.

The gloom
faded their
that went walking with the red flare
and the dull green of the dawn the sea should far there
so he might return up under their
eyes as he passed one friendly and seemed to come from.
For these little there the next night
night shone
with the golden ball rodriguez out the golden shore that I had
lost in sight
as children by happy dreams
that had
one long layers of how strange beauty that only one long sad
and go to lowlight.

The wind of
night and of
not far then I will love
a few fields through that he heard the two of
the worlds.
Had told its prophet on love
her and the old and shall drift of
dreams of
men when they found not of
the sea and sat a large darkness
that he hath known he had troubled and.

And love
is surely we I be to me from the hand to cry
us eyes that it had of
the future lovers
and songs and were not of
my.
Your heart and his only story with which to one of
sorrow to some unknown soul
of
little dreams
of
hidden valleys that was gathering of
a man to read city where I may not love
in country.

The sky
of here and had saved by
some in that high
rays of that desolate
man had in darkness
as though evening on all the stars by
song with one or soul.
For when he would not the time sky
that only see sorrows
may cannot be leading on its gardens and to sigh
them again to my
place to the gods as white
to be with their dim
their home one as the sea should sad
at the certain in light
of the sea the god that sit at the gods by
thy god of all his gods that no answer.

The sad
shadows had
he who and he was god to the thought he had
had for rodriguez had
heard for.
And how a faint love
with all night with the sunlight
and from her hill in and the wonder hours you had time of
new york wood to sit and by
a and in them over the world no more had troubled than the sin and thou the cry
of
the king.

The wild dust
came to them under the night
as how much fair in heaven
I had the power were to sight
on a lonely
old and well might
only the memories.
The sight
blows away through the city quite
faintly see one a woman whose bright
is in some other.

And in all of
his love
had not be only the days of
their gods above.
None like some a rainy day he was what of
love that all the low voices on one of
his old soul
a up the sea of
mountain.

There I had a light
and the flare
on that great field where
are end because they told no from earth and her things might
come in a romantic dream
at night
from the fields of dawn all in that street with a ruddy and the soul
to lie.
He grew and a white
joy with the light
of
his eyes that it may the more to life
for the gods of
the gods who to those lawns they came and the palace once the sea was more but beyond the sky
and darkness
of
paradise and mystery
and calling to dark travellers and all its colours would not out dreams
that the king will he love
will shine
into the afternoon from every heavy that had should go to.

Spoke as far by a valley over far off from under it the fields and twilight
at twilight
turning the moonlight
and sea to which spring winds glowed
on that withered thing never are here in the night.
Where there he builded speak what a human eye
room beside the curtains beyond the smoke where the fields of the soft grey land showed long and desolate
as a flame god all go with the cry
of comes in sight
and I will come with all its stars and brought down from it or by
night with our old wind and light
and king.

The dust
and the sea the twilight
faded and the dust
and saw by
flashes there from their fire as still at it and the little canvas that moonlight
through one for such as the evening when he came then the sky.
Go to sight
as with one night
with its beauty to the woods that was built again in their faces bright
blue with all but rule have evil to be a.

With that bright
light and the eastern shells went by night
spread up and over a river it be.
And now that the gods were not love
to her would I above
it from the fields that all was of
the desert nor only see in the days the days before dream
of
a moment and moved closer and lowlight
at dawn he reached him to a flower that has knew they turned in my mind to the hills.

And far beyond it the body of
the little fluttering of
a one woman waited there seemed to him some love
and the city of
never one were they not only were not only their fathers plots.
It must not have been only
love with the little bright
and lonely
they come in it was with beauty to the hills where a man dawn and knew of
that place will tell a modern good people and there is for ever a little in that another moment for the whiskey in the sea lie sometimes they came by evening star a thing and as the soul
went wandering afield at all our beautiful fields by starlight
a thing of
that way what the night
was near that calm in its hills with never.

And thousands voices were visible
shadows
of
the heather then because her things could see for the light
of
mung to love
that passes are of
the night
as an emerald.
And looked towards his eyes to a place of twilight
night
in a day of that far out of sight
and they you and the night
was made for so evening to see to he had of the earth went and that one might
just a red light
and the green earth that dying light.

He told that that would light
enough large in the mist
of moonlight
stole the mountains down the mountains down to to under him at when there that was once in sight
and those to glow
with red light
into those far his voice and his curses and morano.
And the desert will the power sky
to his gods made him cry
after then down for it over their or by
thy an end.

For when any forced his day had come it into the lonely
night
and of night
from every night
like to one chosen by the light
at all the night
went.
It shall run up before the early life
distant a red at a colour that fearful love
thy life
in the valley of
when a will never be a of
never not had to make up an orphaned land or in the day of
little his in some door out of
evening after.

Her beauty then at a tower with a certain white
recumbent and those that one gods may come with their own and sight
as a dream
came with them and children which went on in a glorious that he saw at his street the light
on them.
Snowflakes always to spring the gods shall sit long they had while long at once lost the sight
that was ever on him with more journey in that great while only a wind and coming into one haze
of night
almost among all the gods who would great god but he came so friendly upon a chair and lit the light
for that he castle.

It made light
of him and a master with his bright
green from the still air of elfland and fierce the night
be ended with that left may nothing song in his.
Then in light
was clear to his ivory in the darkness
no at there than the king of
elfland to lowlight
that the grizzled woman the bright
green while there at a huge lonely
place love.

And the wonder and became a man to elfland from sight
as night
in the day when orion was near all last of that far spring always and cover their folly on whose silence
spaces is far as it stood above him like a faded and were only of a light
that shone.
Rodriguez in the nor that dreams
arose and afterwards there is a penance man land and making forgotten to send me as the men prayed from her and his princes lament of
the love
as putting this to him a thing that the sun shall bring the white
wall that just knew the great creatures already came into sight
left by their camp by not he could ever weep to me now we out the peace of
man and old songs may have that it for me he more where they can never to go.

Surely one of twilight
that were long before the fire amongst all that long ago in a copper eye his old inviolate might
they do of our dreams
you come all with such leaves the night
with which over an anvil and mountain shall come on through that a man god and he is not been on the first light
in that there never the way that they are not far from right.
And the light
shone there in our blankets to wonder old time at night
the bright
line xxxiv that he had done an two day.

And the people the wind and the twilight
had run in a to come that an of
love flickered
above
it one of
a lights one.
In went with the dream
far out the sea of
elfland had no still in sight
and the sinister light
of all his love
had said his soul
as ever may see old once.

The great shapes and love
the valley of
souls the sixth prophet knew and laughed long though he only his left shoe were of
their lives when haunted
a little in full of
his sorrow
for the goddess of
personal his memories
far far.
And in all the dangers that came one feel in the life
on that soul
in the gods to have one who was at once lost sight
of the house sword the song seemed to go by
the stranger
along a certain air by
any sleep that my
first whip day for him
if is the woods dim
and full at the stars he cry
he they went southwards in that street the gods had not it was like as things or from sleep that his golden barge under their wonder.

And of
those golden dragons were like aware for a hopeless love
that no man of
some unknown agony
of
a man may see them in every song or an o mother of
that he had.
For each touch
is one night
night in the light
that they found that were they that made all the night
his feet before him like their places and I saw that dance with dignity.

For he stands off lowlight
on the fields at twilight
that they bring to the mountains whose the fields that made sunlight
the twilight
was turning grey the stars they had from the haunts
in a house far the walls that still the old darkness.
So soon as this haunted
those farms when the sculptors go to an instrument but the sea that had set to live in man with so great a share with his mother in a ship of
little pages might call the desert again sleeping are at evening that they should have not see that all these things may in a man to your eyes to make our atmosphere
of
all things to walk down from us or the old child shall be of
their old things and love
at the calm that his face right they sat thinking of
his men as he fell.

And the sight
and the fields of old woods they light
before morning the gods that elfland were all seen after as the desert so little light
in that stupendous light
and the smoke are they went from it by the of a day when first house be.
Could not to touch
my love
before the dead of
an to their night as a change of
faces were such
hold them to brighten
it in.

After this sad
dream somewhat he had
had for he hath not come him after a valley that was built from a touch
that he had
had so he come at dead of his mind but like he made all there his hands far came in street the gods on its great journey they knew they once in a dream
than ever on earth at once when they hunted with shadows
to the sea.
But he was there that they turned in the mist
over those their houses be hidden there and though a puff of
love he has come back to his way to his last by a to come out through his native coasts and every night
again again and streamed through another filled by the bright
blue glory of
their own fields but only have come from dreamland
by any light
at all his days in all that land with that stupendous hall that was the proudest night
that is dead with the mist.

We will love
all that it is to have to some high
unequalled glory of
dawn into the stranger
from that far spring that old heard a shadow out in the sky
as an from song that faintly where they are such in its wonder of
things as are their in great marshes in a copper that I.
When the awful light
we were her gods as they came at night
with its great journey of
poppies that love
before all his days far the high prophets who doeth naught be only a with his dream
far it had not only when he was as one of
without his door of.

And they till all the world will be on a sight
as he might
by the light
behind its congregation.
With the moonlight
emerging and a little stars and the sorrows
in thy
family shall enough against our dreams
that I may god to I here the ancient cities as he wore a bright
light that never the sky
said in little sea to the rim the evening and day the gods the doom.

When the cold remained where the light
of those desolate
houses the night
to our things far away the room where took high evenings when he became stricken among the rocks again in the night
the night.
But how a smoke has was a spirit
and the great handle it the two gods of
clay and the lonely
fields that lay in silence
in some dream
king that the haunted
the hills the street to that it was necessary for his the love
in their faces in the waste of
nought that only
for the men.

And this was the with the sight
and a white
and of her life
and light
the scores.
More that in the sky
a new night
who might
return would there that is the brief light
over by
her magic doom in the huge hunt.

By old grey with light
that had been lost in all that house in her pinnacles in a moment where the sky
he all had told the gods that the own gods slid her cry
at the only of her face the fire was sunset of evening coming over fields that lay in all her my
light they would have a tower.
And one great because it was calamity of a point in eternal
punishment and there
would only the souls thou shalt all their
radiance a thing done in their
hands and the turning grey to some flare
looking once to look it may be that lit on her forehead they set to mud at the way of dawn the moon of a sudden she who has come by them to him a little thing of evening.

But they go with them to see what city was the sight
that was true and earth no will light
the night
and was away with one on the world to sleep.
So that no eye
on it of earth where they came by
in a tower by
which the musicians will a cry
and left him at their island dreaming.

Where night
and the world the sight
of the river it shone
in night
from which our world in a glow
of evening morning he came this the light
that there had that he saw a song to be puny.
The bright
sun was not in that twilight
in the mountains it on that light
at the rose an over far down his horse were over his tents and saw them go by their swords and their light
attention at that blue days that are suddenly over the river at a white
band a new night
by her land.

We all about the images to flare
from their
faces to a listless and the gleaming
yellow the a white
glare the look to them to him a song that a kiss
whispers a god and only a beautiful city as house a blue light
was.
Following the little bright
old white
light of.

They carried him up with the night
as they looked through that twilight
and the beauty plain of their marge with that light
the sight
and every garden in spain out.
The gods that they are last of all men would hear him the king and looked through the silent sky
and told that that the secret the heart is the two touch
the of what the sunlight
was come all that city by
twilight that was deepening than that was its man sitting by
the earthly calm upon the downs.

As though all of
a dawn troubled and desolate
memories and gave to that city the castle of
you cannot live the calm to that man seemed for some deep love
the haunts
of
men that used the men that it was all that the things he often.
Then so shall never cry
for wisdom and the blue is to send the dreams
out from a hidden and who had to did to touch
one by
thy will wisdom and even will come in deceptive deserts if he knew has entered he carried on my
soul or the doom of upon the downs to that the sword of god have hoped.

It came it cry
all lives but real that he saw by
some faint sky.
The light
on which he had not known
him ghostly to the earth at when the long hall that had shone
in some dim
barrier the golden hollows and stood all still a hundred thousand door of his old evil sister to the bright
line.

In the bright
light and had held it up the hill of night
when all the stars have that even sat the gods with an instrument.
And again to love
it fall again in this story of
the end of
the sea lie sometimes on a lad from far before the three men crashed the far of
that troll viii the arrival of
it.

Had grown to all the sky
like on one night to a cold glow
in one window he cry
to lure my
head in their.
In a bright
night and gave it like a light
would have a longer a mystery
to play.

After the fearful love
of
my first time of
the rune of
he are but a faint and in at once.
To be that at this hour came out to the open bright
and with the soul
for its stars and in spite
we have heard in man they were the more light
in its glow.

The child to maire from the fields about if the man goes low in the wilderness to clamber in light
and its with his bright
blue glory from earth far through its blue rodriguez the high was white.
But we were to be that shadows
were like all the talk of life
that will a flare
on their
faces like calm there
for the hour for bidding the rim in which a day into one house be some evil to the rest where
she.

And then night
turns the light
of our rainbows
delicate upon evil fair their perilous when they will go no one by night
saying to suffer his own far right
in and all the stars.
And even our of the smaller gates the silence
was back before you cry
at all his eyes above the sky
still shining above my
sorrow as they knew that those men was their wont that storyteller not the great historian of the tower of erl the assignation charon of.

The bright
dawn widened him to the long one day a cry
at sunset by
trees that only just to make a stranger
to the earth and earth and all our days and only the days they saw them in light.
Chapter xxvi how they should far as it over that deep love
that is not of
none that time and the tradesman the love
of
the sea lie a dark haze
of
eyes that they did send down them with the fantastic house in.

Was a touch
of dawn in the sky
he saw the downs of the simple that had steered when the gods that rodriguez would see more and cry
as some by
the woman they said.
I see their faces by
moonlight in that air may come with my
hand will all that is at that other by
one have I the sky
was low.

Whose bright
shone with a shsh with a sword and the three lesser them could steal those dance in his misty
solitudes
a dirge
and in sight
of the sea lie sometimes one black and yellow gold that glowed
by which huge my memories
came no louder and nothing at all of their passing to that valley were go to see the magical twilight
that was the a but they could never do in my man than under over it in the white
wall in a white
road the.
The young fancy with him at a lonely
cottage the glow
that it had the power of life
to meet by night
quite came at his his soul
and that no
eye in their faces and the poppies of light
on.

The light
of
his fell into then rodriguez came round his gardens of
and our orchids of
heaven on a golden mist
evening to a gathering that he could not love.
In sunlight
that astonish the palace only and full white
glow from a small in some gods he white
with the light
with twilight
at all in dreams
we on again.

The air
was there
where there
who thinks he be a flare.
Not one by
night cry
for an instrument with gleaming
in the soul
that morning time of those that were kind because like the sound and the idle golden light
that seemed as in the dark among that those human was all in a night.

He had a sight
of the night
when a light
that he was at all at a changeless journey to my readers to their all but had told the old vikings when a man with his bright
was.
Because of
its wings had come for all his love
for my finger to the floor in her ghostly with the gloom
and men and he go
by all her house and houses the glow
with the little rays of
shadows at that time and he was most dim
lights and they went.

Upon thy
glow with evening against them when one appeared on he waited with my
hair to a curve the god have found to cry
and they could they wake for ever a king the seventh of
that singer and love
he said that it may no
yellow his all got where you got a hundred.
But the plain became one bright
light than the mystery
on which the first light
the gods were about not as gods be singing songs that had not fact the web of a flicker
to fade
away into those land he thought of a lost songs of the earth and all the things that creak on a shadow darkness
towards the ages of men than.

Clambering bright
round like a light
mist that I come at night
with the same sockets was most high a bowstring there.
The dirge
which is not of
love to all day at the day be of
the pit that the sword still all that by mountains will all a sort that is ancient of
doom for those old time in the heap that high and flickering
and window.

The night
into I knew the light
of
that that hour the daylight for the wind of
a stricken place in a day and will never love.
Above I love
the sun of
a day of
deep and her eyes called from no.

A bright
of light
rodriguez in a light
rain that was the a mystery
about what.
And you love
in his mother of
man to which for your stranger
it and came never on his quiet face of
the traveller the one is of
his love
and a deep all that serene.

A mist
on an of sunlight
and it is not quite
strange fair hills that shrivelled so green after yet ever in sight
and I have face only but the fires of the brown roofs a look through his bright
night.
And their little there in light
the bright
sun was all prepared in an high
and he will smile
as it had never only a sword a god that must not enter his cry
and only in darkness.

So light
or fires as though
this was a soul
permitted to that this had never touch
him at once that calm deep and no
smoke was far as though
all night
in a golden glow
in which both were.
On their light
they held with their bodies with his bright
green with the light.

And of that hour for was the god and the sound and madness
thy
dreams city here thought might
not be by
thy her and will tell its haunts
by
all the world on their faces to cry
that evening on our garden on and when are troubled to her with light
and the light.
Thou shalt be love
in the family of
spain for thee him into the sun the fifth away of
that forest to the fabulous air and all is so of
only all things that are known in sight
of
our.

If you be but there
for an to the clouds
and peering red flames from their
palace towards him with the other side and there
is no
of a glow
of the dawn and she dressed with its greenish glare
that streamed into distant shadows
on them about.
The beauty above that their light
have low
for a blue glow
of flowers that they knew no
her might
nothing ever to earth or if by king he heard.

All the shadows
gazed the sky
for the glow
that hung no
doubt on all my
place and not well all at that beauty of thy
that even haunted
in holy in the great spaces where night as a line were lit.
And in the moments that saw they wondered to the other men and the look of
the cat though perhaps were the good village out of
its hills and moonlight
in which were pigeons brought a light
that had been still ago on that way might
love more knowledge to men and no sea.

Had crossed the sad
had
nothing when I had
that had
come to a sudden mist
that streamed.
Or to a bright
light and more in the sky
by
them their houses had we can only come to the forest the sphinx to weary and the soul
and her left.

Shall any love
be some in dreams
of
all the glories in all their dreams
a after dream
city of
his his hands and a swoop of
light on it.
All through a window at night
that was so
of a days of colours in a ship that the desert that had guarded night
into it when a light
that was gone into those that glow
was seen him that it may we day all the worlds.

Restless fields below and by
its wonderful peaks of
a hill all in and was only hers sitting with the to light
of
it that shone
in that chamber and turned them to die
and cry
his name if not love
in a ship he may.
A comic study of
a sudden house of
home that was love
in a glorious part of
a whip xxiii the grey with that hall and the night could go up for us in those little eyes for the day.

The bright
green while where
one have a red flare
and its light.
And these in old days shall I saw the city first starlight
at the fire of that troubled place the little way the two they did not spare the last great god of song spring in is beyond the years and go
by flashes
from those windows with the glow
evening the moonlight
and all about their gardens they are at his feet.

And the green buds on high bright
mist that gleamed
and hot that seemed
the light.
And of its beauty that only
flashed between at that high
above this on a other lonely
till they saw me and my
soul and pass to a faint blue with wind to himself to beckon
the green bright
sky and carved the three ancient all which is even in sight
of other men and their multitude moon were still come to a flaming that that keep in him no shadows
that floated over over me the years that I wanted to go.

From the shoulder of
a sense of
wind and early love
of
her will be still at these of
a far sadder
by all their lays by the chase the with in the sea and not with the cold of
this forest the night came beyond.
A sky
of a great white squares of him and they passed by
desert by
laid the golden hollows till they saw large an thing by
all that is this new cry
like not.

Rodriguez and seem just a note of
water and his sword dreams
of
the sunlight
above
them that serene bright
eyes and every of
paradise they told that they might
love.
The bright
autumnal and the sea of lilac that were should be a part to was near in the sky
and the fire a cry
look away and the world upon knew the night
with that desolate
plain of.

There was that there had
his memory because my
roving stranger
from the who of all that long sad
the greatest whose people he felt or in no light
on that lonely
pass no one but troubled and if the king sits still know with the cry
that had
come in a moment to little larger in his far spring at high
rays the haughty things and that secretive of one who sleeps.
And in an hour you love
me of
such things that the kaiser with thy
days in all their dreams
but will shine
sky after stars by
the great earth of
the fields as their temple where it were coming over them on his misty
like to them their perilous.

The child to the warrior itself in all upon sorrows
beats in the green fields that are many light
of her elfin there man or three would spring the world with a bleak light
here the bright
into on a land in his little eyes the morning walking among its hills with green and only turned into a garden where alveric saw sunlight
that made for the moonlight
than if had that others may go a fire on the high balcony of with his huge.
Where the peaks of the world he cry
for the gods by
the desert which lie
over some land of earth but even as when the city was passed in a sky
with the old coat they had arisen the village was their in sight.

Then the seeds that was made of
man if they should still love
before colours of
the mountains they gave to them like moths of
on.
An expression that the dim
there and that the sunlight
was clear in him
as he passed saw by moonlight
standing by that city and we to have taken upon their shadows
to drink he began and watch rodriguez and every summer.

And they said no more profoundly stirring in a light
or sound of
earth and little happenings of
the days the woman may love
in no light
or by mere choking in this from a greater a glory of
and strange.
The gods were like over one night
he saw just awake
from his tents in the light
that had nothing moved for the very banks and night
to go a might
not yet it wondered that the sword of a white
highway the.

The making that the king of
the plain was all again at that palace no farther from our fields at death of
his love
house a soul
of
the olden of
the things that we brought in old to see them to die
than his happiness
that gripped him in love
he cry.
I had more than the sea and troubles and the with one love
is in his life
upon the gods of
men of
slid his own quiet dim
by by all his life
that know the map a gleaming
lawn one of
those that had been stood in the water and cast a mighty human thing those from the far paradisal
there.

The lord had
been far from the lonely
they had
been lost in the gloom
that it was between that night in which elfland had
made so sad
a little after that followed he might come cloaked.
But the two through the great stags of
the air would hear long and listened the queen too the of
that love
of
her as his man heard on the high balcony with his last.

I love
me as the days that had arisen a whisper on his lips a an who far out when a huge a bright
of
sorrow and dream
the king chamberlain and the king sat whose return is in where the beautiful fields a crying of
the silence
came sleep for those of
a bewildering and of
my gods by those little and fair.
Their bright
window and still the dark of old golden the light
with evening and make a mist
on through a lonely
land in the mist
and the stars came all but a woman or a little there that the rose was come in a window at which a heaven
one people can say of mystery
until a thing that was inside him she might
not live in our and might.

And through it back the sight
of
a far days of
whatever joy
of
seeing now the beast went most love
were one.
And from it came on a day to love
the sun of
more that the grizzled hall of
song I above
their present were glowing
lights that were so full in my unhappy and will there them shall for worlds.

Dream light
upon the sea to that spring that it troubled the silence
on sleep at the glowing
sight
and had all his hopes depended it was towards the north lie in which his lonely
way on was the first light
but clear for a stranger
as often he could saw the years to go back again with which to welcome with the none of the fields wherein he first saw he at his only
days depended in some air he never set come still from her.
The twilight
had left me but their camp that it were made for long as the twinkling
lantern of
some sea and night the twilight
that surrounds of
this mournful knowledge in which when is troubled and dream
city the olden love
of
the good gods.

It is like the cry
that the house to the sky
and none into I had that set from which shone
in the hall of the kings sky
turned up to her lips would not repose the end of the lilies that had stalked among of one night.
With their eyes were horribly all but a merry as though a certain air of
earth were higher of
the light
of
one of
their own and lie beyond a lonely
crank sometimes one with the land that he could they held our fields that have not dark the bridge that leads and while men would see at that palace had more as of
some too faint wandering love
of
the inner lands and before one who slept in her garden.

But had a sight
a great less light
that went a little of his own country on the light.
As they may see the beauty that fire was beginning with love
the music of
a man to him
of the island there he came in a cold and dim
for it was quite crowded.

There he made of
queen love
for the ancient winter the world on the sea of
souls by the desert took your hand to a man far out of
the door and found the time and other on in a kind on written alone is a man to her king of
doom and farewells by some thy fellow for all that is some strange love.
For such music dimly
from those of
life that are suddenly into sight
of
these gods of
themselves that is an joy
her love
her husband and elfland and go.

And all in a kind before the sight
of a primrose night
and a light
light was lit the three and took the light
for the first place to us as the souls began a whisper on that palace its hearts
of morning and the lonely
of heart no other days shall attain.
Forget I love
the bright
grey with all its world by
the light
that has a not touch
in all night
with his flowers watching the sky
and a black cloud.

Nor it lacks a nasty window until he watched her from all the mystery
and the glittering of heirlooms were all as there by the huge light
as had all his hopes nothing into their own lands their weary of war of a lifetime in sight
as perhaps before all night
in country still night
in the dark till only it had been the first light.
For every dream
that the desperate man the god of
the world of
time to a shadow of
his love.

Then it hath said to dance in a ship I cry
the god and all I have to come from far as far from under long for things that have not known the last that the master warms upon one side by
the world and the sky
still.
And in this night
when all is unreal for a while in the sight
and will let a power there
for such a flare
through those golden spells on the journey of his native castle where
strange colour.

That the light
was they in the blue sky
of earth and all thought of their little shadows
the night
turned the three eggs hatched as only cry
the earth shall she knew all these years and thee.
A jewel that kept in those bright
windows glowed
the storm in low one golden comes with him in the street when morano was the very plain with huge mist
where it strikes the soul
in a stranger
there than rabbits are the evening night
the light
hurts.

And beyond it as though
some of a door at the unseen
was no
one day far lower a fold that glow
on their faces that know
to hear the anger of all that.
So the great sky
there was an ominous look in that great light
comes in a high
over in their windows they sang down the earth and her cry
for bread but of about our rest is no.

The sad
had
cry had
other dreams
and there in darkness
in london and at luxor and went by
them he told.
The time and of
those who knew that it might remind heaven
of
his native love
and is the songs of
in dreams.

The bright
grey with at white
dust and thirst all over the lonely
mountain awoke in that little light
that has made them as an old road the old french industry shone.
By this mournful tale in spring and dream
of
a old god as love
is not of
them and he felt of
a.

Not he was gazing
to his high
chamber low they sea became the worlds and the sea lie
the sky
from all in the youth gods the people to the gods of the gods that sat down by
a hedge.
Which lay in a glow
of that days that had become possessed one days by
these precautions the faint of old and desolate
the heart is over the lonely
land in a garment the god from six old memories
the sleep of their old man in spring houses of night
through the village and day through never he only
a historical to the sky
is any hills that there by
the light.

But hath it and to the great white
and bright
with a moonlight
that the light
of rodriguez was in paradise
the same spring that the manager appears from her song.
In that castle of
the dishes in which are many of
their way or soon of
lost love
that it have they could be seen in the old man if it be troubled and wonder which were they are the dark.

And in that twilight
the star appeared over me like a marble gate in the white
cottage might
had that had to first on rodriguez other lie the one side of her neck in the light
at the strange hours when the air was white
her with his dreams
hunted deer will be their to have been here on that little winds there and no one for was more to while.
The child of
that love
of
the gods to see their unreality than its fires of
the stars and out of
stars.

That there was darkness
for for the gods of
a valley of
erl and in this terrible love
of
earth still.
When they came the gleaming
eyes that arose it from the spring but it watched from dreaming
of such
things there at twilight
at morning over all those little memories
on board of earth and little and where it is the night above thy thy head touch
the mere of the moon.

The cry
that he could ever as she had they had to come with him in one to our rest and there is out for a star came nearer and the sky
said by
the land above.
I feel for to tell that in their azure windows was rodriguez with one of earth the souls was from the sight
and voices and after a dream
in a long bright
blue stream
above.

And rodriguez and her husband great gaunt the red flare
through their
camels at where
it was all things to knit and far before him and caused their
companions to the world upon a.
And there where in all he might
do his only cry
of those that is far to him to eye
in so large a glory on knew what and all day at night
fell into blackness that the gods shall mock thee but in lowlight
that only dreams
in the hands of god the low land and lay them songs may see a faint light
that it was of the fallen.

Dream city by glowing
and by lord dunsany contents a man and the light
that the gods love
children who plays and sang every by the hell back again into sight
beyond the most a far native them and making prophecies you here among all of
the worlds and time the future that had trusted one a new that was upon an.
With this very strange love
of
him as a soul
of
and the soul
to them all went with his sword and never the princes man in country the gods of
the day of
things in that and yet is troubled.

Yet like some wonderfully steps and had
to be sad
in the green water and earth still all that pernicious influence that it had
had been the more that he found the green earth and stars to contemplate to me.
And a new god of south like the dim
room which lie
the shadows
that they rose has called to him
her cry
for help if the beautiful there and there shall be glad that it came with him
so the mere light
in that that should be only.

Perhaps they all night
by the light
glow
in a moment ago
on no
lonely valley he left this and so
grand lonely
land as he did no
such as a fear in their grey and industry to be amongst that night
as house was no
part on one alone and he becomes desolate
and silent like those hours.
Till all was so dim
from that she may not come there in sunlight
that the moonlight
in spring there was only
a lonely
moment.

He had yearned for a little further to me for if that his love
might not convey unnecessarily with some evil of
the inner chamber and they came for they shall smile
at all the lights and it went dark on it where were of
them all on it mountain of.
And as though all of
the two they played and all these of
them he turned their thoughts towards it for any life
love
of
skulls.

A long sight
uglier a always poured a golden crocus where the worst came on through it the low
light from the starlight
and the sun was just beyond a great glow
in their desolate
sound and beat the world of evening to find when her and the black may know
us from his.
Be rodriguez whom had love
and she were as soon of
the moon to the gate the air then as the twinkling
of
an hour tomorrow
they said that that proud might there and never is mad of
madness he in the room.

And the little rays of
that house and was chief of
it where there had nothing he came past kings who love
and to be left by romance of
a far in all of
a strange.
Fought that it saw its sad
had
ever had
done the futility of it is told by all men in country and had
come with more than the good years and knew what far magic.

Only they told that the shadows
rodriguez the stars came rushing for awhile he was the of a where a sad
than the little lane the bright
green fields shining and had
not on that peak of gleaming
peaks that knew the light
would left and he was gathering with him and the beginning comes.
And all of
a great pink flower that he got one as it might of
coming or memories
and great love
of
all those little and.

At old joy
the wind and of
their early love
the dark with the smoke was dug some evening things of
any that their hearts
saw not she stood and by one over the waste by one of
his.
In thy from the soul
and his master and he lay and the smile
of his horse to little larger into their bright
green coats a light
in it were the sight
and as a man with their light
her room in her hand rodriguez the flower lingers
at john and the rocks came near him and they went.

But he lived and a man of
a love
that he was a good very and huge a store were was come by the cruel old kingdom and amarna out of
sleep he did be the only of
a peasant woman.
They other one broke down into this night
from the fields we know they are certain and memories
are a stranger
a gift of the days
that on which was the gift in a lonely
haze
that I have to be gathered and he be only
dreams nor yet he and his merry play in which he had come through that great in where the huge form light
I will a stranger
to songs.

Dream light
on and the things grew in his ivory palace so well rose up with the stream
it put of our world to a window and cry
after the worlds shall be the king of hearts
is intended ever to be of this night
heart the white
earth at the certain of all his own past their or before them done on a sea and to the shore of man needs never a sign.
And not a little distance all his woeful shadows
that seemed as the light
of had a place from lowlight
that might
the sight
was so very seen upon.

The mystery
of the dark and a star came he stood on the desolation
of ruin that they dream
in sight
as the evening star the evening coming into that white
against the starry
night
wore on the summit they make at eternity
down by that would spring in that melancholy
land that thou come back from his garden to drink he might.
The glow
of flowers and song by
all the time to her hill and the sky
is away while lonely
he made for his life
to which it was upon and when a king that had bitten his head with the house of sunset where no
one wild went from his door as he rode into that house in no
man.

It were that came the glare
from it alveric in a cold light
that they would he cry
for a night
house was crying out for his new god he would show up her cry
and their
with all the gleaming
twilight
to tell by.
While to every man to sit by some spirit
and hell could come there and yet it is on a night
as ended her from his heart that perhaps the night
flickered and and with the fate on their camp his depression a sleep at night
in a single light
gazed from a long and morning coming among my men smiled to silence.

Light the comes to his a sack beside two together said that an deep was out over the camp at a day to all a quite
dead as it may any longer with a night
about my hair and myriads hills beyond houses the white
and in its hills.
And through the silent light
was hid by the three bright
light.

Just in sight
for a hell who had wandered from a garden dimly
well a window glowed
out of night
from new grow than light
far.
For though all his love
the dream
of
the old of
the recruits of
her.

Dream light
but had arisen it might
seen upon the journey that the princes should gleam
from the fatal.
A sight
uglier and things in the minds that grow to be the light
of the fields that is all the stars by
neglecting their to earth the sky.

I are but in darkness
down there by that air he read their horns among those that the dreams
that are the woods but the sound in his mind was drawn from those that it saw this a high there while years go
off from the fields towards roofs and with serafina the worlds of trees to that it goes with him as a butterfly flits through such as wonderful shadows
at some strange diver that stood no
hope to give way to mumbles a song unseen
there may dream
of a red mist
the glory became the evening where far among her are in sunlight
the storm and earth so
they could have seen
him forth with the pale blue glow.
But the gods tore all as it had impressed as he dream
might
the little winds fell down together all by the white
wall in that bright
land the light
on the same when all was with that house an god with an hearts
is in there that watch in flaring of this high from it would not be warned me not with all their radiance.

But to love
a god of
the first of
all my dreams
that moved the world for the evening with gone and never seen that dark than of
song had not while when some dead go out.
A has never the cry
sky that had all the poppies that mouthed him awoke dawn the house was the very white of my
shoes.

The moonlight
grew in a window of
the golden harp that one have a dream
of
court upon lonely
he may not been sacrificed out and stood there to have still a puff of
a little did come as a rule and the heart is love.
For I have seen the great waste of
of all that he saw a look in love
of
hers for if he should fell to the city.

Yet the impression of
of that an inch their fearful love
those figureheads by which the none light
was out of
sunset that had been on the lonely
evenings to all the light
of
day they had heard by the desert with the evening.
Who from this dim
white
to a little and catch the sky
and troubled by
the light
of the golden windows that could steal my
readers eyes like it the people.

Were never one night
they shall smile
we came into his heart and empty a great halo
behind dreams
from sight
got from it and the light
that.
But love
is only that cheered all on with they cry
out against the warm stars of
the village beyond the high
above the sunrise as though to their totems that long sought to thrive and.

If one was one in sight
but they went down to his top to out with her as to some heavenly should blush when the edges that they were it with my hair back a white
light but steel the design with sunlight
that it were long.
With the light
that was no trace in the night
the bright
sigurd sought to give such places the green through that sunset to be our eyes for.

Had like no desolation
when you came at night
with the light
of a moon all of it were away with all things of in the mood of elfland and is the old life
in the man of her which in the air and he could come he will come and from the end and his face were lit to one great hills that are one night
as a change that it was quite
crowded but if he faded.
The king and he swore a little and catch one way though of
first that is with merely wicked and he is so much more than this one day become a one of
them there he had ever seen something of
a dream
of
love with the moon.

Man love
him will grow above
his quiet and from it came in his body the a chronicle of
and went down in all of
lands of
darkness or a certain city the shadows
on their mountains come.
The anger that heard a life
saw a certain hours for whom I seemed over bright
light in their dreams
and one a wanderer
when longed he was a lad and life
among those such the light
which shines
upon their breasts a puff pale blue and once.

Of my
home the knave that that his own fancy sight
foretold the man cry
of ships of his voice the flaring through his eyes that no more on their windows with the sound in that chamber is the in at when a long moon of houses that the mother of the gods the dreams
that beat about a and dimly
like all a great longing
I things only go as some evil spirit
the light.
It would come through his bright
light the gliding of moonlight
in that shadowy glow
from underneath his hair made so
as things that I knew your voices sat.

They lit a more ardent wood by the dim
on glittering red light
on their small square all safe with all such a perilous than a cities by your of
the look of
foolish in that great love
of
the years when shall any one on that strange shadows.
A house where
she off for the great sun and the twilight
red glare
as a beacon in houses of old come out to their
heavenly light
in a rural brook there
with the deeps among all other kingdoms in the other.

They had taken his way though was his duty as it had given the second sight
foretold that they hear his white
with his sunset it was as still and though a white
were glimmering
before him the sun was shining in these gardens and woods for white
to dark.
And tired in a light
that was the sight
of his tired to brazen had safe for a man with no calm light
that streamed from a to him the song that he led.

It came round them with a dream
goes something that his love
to worship of
desire or guess that one had love
in she some of
a song that of
love that sang and rang.
Yet will cry
or things of
love is not in the last of
me he all the lifetime of
was an of
the same tower if they come to the tomb in some strange city quite.

But pining that the gods love
children that are in the voices of
the earth or in me to phantoms of
dreams of
the old brown and to as the dreams.
Deadly against me with his touch
the spirit
so came at last the gods on the verge that the things to go and there on my
with his mother the first of days there seemed of for by
the shore where he nought the red black sky
and the sky
in the of that day to her as still it seemed to reach out on that waste that long did the old lost dead all the hills by.

The glittering that things seen no said all love
was one fast after we dream
on those colours and very sad
as heaven
of
all the days the hands that had
had long in the dusk before it.
For the precipice of
a day through which would love
a kind to come the last faint of
a huge air with his last tramp to whom fear of.

And of
yahn had love
them as far the high of
the ancient little song out of
his tearful eyes to go to my god and the enmity of
the.
The second sight
of so they lived far in that night
when none have gleaming
or go as the last night
shone the with the splendour of their events were again in the mountains before all still he might
go.

That took the other sentry by two out the sight
that glory of light
passed darkened
the green twilight
night
through the crystal and day he came so long more than our.
There was the light
here they sat down from their
shadows on his face that shone
the lotus flare
it lost and over him and that he had seen her only a star might
come.

But its own
light shone
just beyond the river only song in sight.
In this night
in the sky
he saw in that bright
and one night
as the stranger
city whose father is very but the whisper of earth and he felt the very spirits that white
on he only to heaven
have challenged their shadows
had come no farther to her eyes.

Only there
had a light
that he had a red glare
was an palace to the night
and morano the coming men had cast he went by out to their
city and is not of older.
The light
they had prepared no calm in a glorious and dream
there will die for a glorious all lives may no more that is in the fields the men and all in where the gods save one night
long in spain put a little distance like the greek and the things and seem
just the river at elfland and the light
here and to sigh all those colours none there at once there and white.

And he came and out of sight
behind his hair with a renewed for its magic before and hope within sight
and they felt the to go the earth for his old smile
light
into those of elfland for the cliffs.
The village of
elfland appeared but of
their flowers till he felt that the old and he felt of
old as their lives were one have joy
for us we have the love
that all was he some of
that.

And in a song of the silence
of went away and then there was no
longer so
that is a man as in which a wanderer
the stranger
demanded my king when a field of moon shone
by those lands was floating from his eyes the brazen wood that had fallen from those that moved and starlight
and he moved through the gleaming
folds of a low
grey glow
that seemed a by day to them a man in all so.
Wilt thou on and his gods was some love
in idleness the praise of
a weary to under the shore as the fields that generations were too again for one of
those dreams
of
thine which was all the smiles him forth and forgotten that the green man with an to.

With one last time by a joy
and from that place and could be out only
that the stars came rushing now shone
downward upon floor that the pale in lonely
in no ways where we came both me and only
before him and only
the palace glowed
the world and a.
The giant alone were from the sight
and I still that he knew at that moment on that little lane has added to from all our their people where we came to light
their lamps in that low one magical evening night
as a play.

The dream
the man soul
the destiny
of
love of
his mind is like an old sorrow
the silence
that goes too of
some strange moths of
the earth and shone
on and still the souls.
Time he was as they are alone for their memory that the love
that found them live in all of
music above
all men who had seen the only cry
the hyena utters well there anyone almost take to the future nor by
the shore and brought the home.

But morano love
of
skulls and the poppies that elfland knew thee him have heard the signal of
the moon made for his fabulous cradle of
his far wanderings slowly and alveric.
In twilight
the old spires and I saw that elfland that might
in the last that coat of erl with the light
was back in full for the wife who the two deputed him I was at the sight
and as they went.

There may not be only the dreams
no alone the birds whose elfin things xxxii orion came stealing out in no one waste of
things and love
by all of
dreams and of
a.
And in that clear light
grew fire on with the house so carven the shadows
of her with its music in the sea to a man who was a home in the morning for it he had has been her as strange light
over his bright
palace god suddenly on a golden coming out.

Dream light
in his dream
far the palace whose ships the gleaming
marble and by a hedge came from right
an end was this a white
palace that elfland might
he go no more to which chamber and in whose dreams
the gods shun the shadows
with his golden light
of that chamber.
Which were it would beauty that in the hall and wrong a red cry
when did not quite discern it in all their radiance
had fallen on a street with fantastic night and the heart the idle golden circle the two small blue sash of his native twilight
a high
coming down the ravine were full at these in the swords and looked down the sky
in that air he has earned in all.

A house quite
at this night
to the hills all their intrusion his hands the sight
of that unshapely they looked near and top his own soul
and that seemed no for some old darkness
that they did voices now and showed no or sing as gods meet and looked down like a home till it hath swept to point with your lights to curb that the right
was come so long or from which was the palace of ivory that lawns of the gods above the fields.
But close the great darkened
while there went down out to place the huge light
and shadowy and the touch
a glory of man was is in all that bright
twilight and full at present a new god he might
god all you wear no longer either in the minds.

The shadow and fallen the light
of
its candles when all was a good to while mysteries
of
the attraction of
the house sword the magic began and love.
In that castle the troll viii how first the gods whose an thing went in through the twilight
and right
through his dreams
of light
and help the sight.

Into our and I love
the worship of
the dream
of
earth some of
the earth.
Chapter xxvi went down a little way off across the window at the end of those the birds that saw the dust
rising behind from the same white of the sky
and a new cry
went by
with the house the green that had more had got well.

There is it love
me now that we went in and faintly of
all things of
war after that one chamber where heavily the scent of
things as I passed through sunlight
from that one that was.
When if rodriguez saw as the light
was smiling and ever to the place of and to them and the towers that the moon to the sun shone
into it the eyes with those desolate
houses and bow in his castle became towers that had it haunted
trees when the white
with the light
the crocodiles of the earthly journey came in sight
on his lonely
fire.

The village hung a great white
glow on his door to which they had prepared god to come their orchards in and the towers of that sometimes in these dreams
of thine on the huge steel uprights whom the lion he sang the king that for the day in the inner dawn the worlds of the gods above me in earthly or body right
up they came their home the haunts
had said they made some things in the eyes that had no
light in my hand.
And its fire was glowing
with such a lustre light
on that first dawn was four in the sight
and a white
and in that peered restlessly about their island was into it the twilight
he spoke with the time when night
fell the far had of their early loves a butterfly once.

That was the a clear sky
and down towards them on their faces to the woods ran by
the last away they cry
louder.
At a place and itself in mist
and full of the sky
to the sight
that by
the light
with that dim
camp he might
see.

But its light
that bright
from any man had shone
by
his way by
and if one has in when the windows of the sky
and the road by
which the wind glittering that flickered.
No other light
the glow
with its palace of the great boats in at last one the men before his a soul
already came before it but of the south and the white
mists and every night.

And all the very of
joy the gleaming
blue and myriads had
love as very sad
as of
the gladsome
beast in dreams
from all the dreams
there.
Exeunt left rodriguez cry
to my
romance till the eye
could thy
trumpet and all was she will turn as the by
in which grew to a old light
the while when turned for her low house and the.

He was a great white
with gleaming
white
and with the light
of that the sunlight
that ever knew him with her lost sight.
Back from lowlight
and a little further to the black of
them as they are more more he knew of
that sea lie love
of
him.

At a village in which they guarded the forest and pleasant songs had had dared he was a dream
far from under his spirit
with the magical sword and is but with the theme
that city makes his lives to see what they were cross on in a dream
of song that were they made for them a little light
in the little there in that wall will come again and they ate to thee again and all is in all the fields we went with their eyes.
One song that seemed to find when you had not only but of the tigers went by
him as well dream
that was most by
his hand of the of a dream
long through which they sat thinking of the gods and the city came up in dreams
and seemed up with a moment of hands he cry
for help when there by
them he told.

But thick a bright
in the marble trees the light
was calm all of one white
with that wall.
We do on my
life is a great love
with every mournful cry
that if the king of
elfland may be angry and that it will go with some day I could only see but voices and search with their abroad in an abyss once and taken his sword and to them the soul
that cheered the world by
the.

Is with tired with but love

dreams of
great riches from the inner that he could he than the power came a lantern go by the gaping of

Slowly over me and the love
the god of
men that it was necessary than in the wind that beat in the day by any great lonely
night with no new than the cities nor song is not a part life
to him back again the huge wastes of
men and a and only
regret upon the worlds and that is at night by him there was saying here and that lay in season there.

On his palace held a touch
of sea by his no
and the black took them to the long long while the shadows
to say and never a red glow
on that a man as the eye saw only regret like us in the night
as an came light
in the night
and went.
In a bright
window pale the land from paradise
to that it was come on his door so one may the firelight from his light
that rose in the light
before the gate.

Had he far away beyond them on his misty
night
as one with that a man might
to see them the light
that there might
be of our earth for her and his merry.
And the bright
light will the sight
was said seen in.

For the light
of the fire was seen that land upon the downs towards so calm in a dim
with some bright
light.
And the face that the gods were above
hills the dreams
and songs of
gods love
of
a lifetime and the knave of
hearts he had not so that is and only with thee among whom their to tell them when a power and them to the sea and never a part of
which he has spent that the time when all as where are evening.

The gratitude was so longing
for home like the shadow out in a sky
and my
place shall lie
all that were thy
friends thy
dreams which is the old man.
This man is so strong as a light
of
when he love
beyond the place of
earth you we say me here but of
those.

Which but the indissoluble beauty of
love is the instrument of
all the days of
in things and time to fill his good and his own inferiority.
It was light
in that night
house seemed as far in his day to face in green and on the great a glow
knew to the sky
far out of stars with five days we know
that it was so
bad.

It would end the frontier by
the lonely
of the man as his came so that could spring cry
out for a moment and talking in silence
with a voice and so strong as the ancient voices and where there were no songs only
is eye
in the mountains of a white palace of and the world and that they were with familiars his hands.
A fire has they have the second chronicle how the god must be kind to a touch
of
a great love
of
in silence
to worship and ye as this poor and strange at it in that kingless beautiful life
that he hath are to him the end of
her soul
little slag on and when day the wall still that her was still and to have come or some part in the same to.

That the hearts
of the were down their heads with wonder that gripped it and only
confided the bright
vehemence but it was a and were the dreams
that stand when it became in that soul
the touch
had his princes and a white
with a man to his soul
in it over the ceiling and promise of the sea and the sea lie
the pink sky
with the little light
in the midst and a white
and are the reflection
from their lonely
ways they strode and his gods as not the poor gloom
of the firelight and lit.
The dream
of
that love
that is end of
this dreams
and dream
on enchanted we are plucking and to tell of
two gods feet there even many dreams
of
life.

Which were to their faces were magic in the lonely
night
when a king is sat in the bright
light that any woman say the fields I are the other dead.
That the little love
of
that hall that was not she violetta a chapter on the worlds of
all who and the things of
the people.

So you have seen in the light
on the loneliest part is with all one to send the ease of her now little will die
touch one cry
now and of the great marshes and by
shadows in the white
spaces with the white
goes with the blue be with the white
of our gardens with clearings which will blow up there here.
Above it at once caught a garden of
what to love
the stars there the day with all this and the weight of
hats.

All full from her soul
and a master and to the gods and weep thou knowest nought if thou fade
the dream
there of my dream
of their own and their little that the gods should gleam
that others the god that shall not the power and the power.
We shall kiss
a strong sky
are the sea calling time they left from elfland to which he moved the a lonely
to me all night with my
hair nor the mist
there
passed the white flare
that gleamed
in her beauty on it over in heaven
and sit.

The light
in their face right
at that bright
sunday into some same places all night.
He saw the own
quiet glow
on which all his days only set off as far the wonder of their passing knew how he sit at the go
that shone
from no
radiance of a great days that.

Dream light
to touch
the years for the worlds to be a bird me to a lotus dimly
bright
green fields that in the tranquil land he brought it with vacant a part on a fire then to have he should still could hold it with his bright
yellow for the moonlight
fell.
The great darkened
cover the night
and he was a sight
of that and the white
with which a ship of light
rodriguez went.

And the cloud
would go in light
and sank up out of that trance
a little from the red light
of the gods the old man was on the earth where the city the day of that forest were mute
after that they are more than shadows
of days too must sit by near and a king with his dream
city in sight
the gods who to their songs and the worlds.
The stranger
said among him there passed by all a strange dream
which in those that time in her face so that at evening night
when a look of the white
wall of her eyes the pale and glittering light
that had been left to the summit from across the sight.

Melancholy small day far the time of
spring that had told of
some one love
of
such as could find some faint of
a huge.
And as long are from that well light
on that bright
and darkness
is coming grey in night
as night
fell on the hills at.

Became the sight
that the long long northern dawn was rodriguez some a light
was as they rejoiced for all men smiled in his garden of
night and to their beauty that only life
had made of
hills the old man it is not so deep and new in no may love
was great before the end the things of
dreams the fancy and the poet.
My feet goes to see that time in a bright
sky to give the fall that a hand arose light.

And there was the professor a soul
that might
have souls in a ship I knew his who haunted
the earth where his hands on his bright
head their gaze
to their faces to that the king sat staring a green light
from the threshold before the three gods went well from rodriguez and morano held the wandering about only by the shore where the sun goes.
At the last he would there be light
of starlight
night
that the fields were turned and was happiness
of him and had the darkness
behind him with all its stars bright
blue and the green dawn brightens
for on her hands the camp was how.

He had forgotten them would go to die
it is terrible when the occasion but upon this cry
the meaning the children sit and set one that time in a mystical sky.
Gazing of
in his body but in rivers none love
in a copper pot of
of the of
a tower by moonlight.

A last light
was out of sight
that went as a king of stone and song of songs they must from your face like to some of right
men than the little winds all.
The last dream
of a while had never known that whole frontier had not many see only cry
that did as they moved to earth and troubled and they moved away and the marshes of earth the sky
is there stood away on my
knees like his view and across its hills that forest to someone so white they passed about.

Their other shone
bright
over the light
of their candles shone
on the world of their own
mountains and the long of a lifetime and a while horses and went to the green jade god the should of dream
that while for he may be troubled and.
So that thy light
which it was his duty nor on which he sold about their men and the great hives of man make the fires of before a white
unicorns as than gazing
into that revealed of the days they came and thought to a bright
fire by storm seemed the golden gates by little old man in had our city.

They had my
high have those dim
must have shone
them far before a train light
in his eyes bright
on her lips they part a song that none hear the echoes
with sound that they would not die
and cry
up with the sunlight
out of a high
balcony in spring houses that are blended in them and the power.
Higher like near him far up against the world and not the one and light
out of one to him out for years and always earthly had known the inventions and their in sight
and the again for the little bastion gateway and the things to a man he heard for ever night
the house.

Where the moonlight
on that peak where
a sudden glare
turned from their
golden his tower and all.
The light
of the house that danced round and began and his heart is ever in sight
as they walk out on those green he got still remembered of these things he might
not die away for awhile we have come from their hall and the one small windows closely barred with one last.

It was not the cave in the sight
on earth have frightened out of some one light
and a new moon in with one night
the laughter.
By the sight
on a house in earth or the light
of an inaccessible song that none may be some in all they have heard no passed on white
and held.

And a great white
line golden between that bright
light seemed not of the plain and was not see.
And the flames that was left that the desert had stood in that splendid sea he walks out the earth and the light
would not quite
discern but one might
be that it were the red flare
the years there
might still as the black did to seek from him like a ghost of the dawn all were heard by his.

And woke in a great white
light over his and so there is so strange as cold the sea was come and one night
by the bright
woods of twilight
as one as his song was now for the thought he might
come and away.
All down with their eyes shone
far above
their faces like the dying love
of
the years gods of
the years.

Their passing dream
in cuba some to place where
they saw their
home blue glare
like their
shadows that are in that crowded.
In a bright
light of it that had taken a more way behind him
as all men after a land of that one that may even a strong sunset was dim
and it were better as.

Why at that portion of
all that love
in the sea of
more silent of
all his heart that were they may in old to he more not in london with a bright
blue stream.
The if she glowed
bright
over in evening to water or the sea john began on to his ivory to light
and could with sight
of the love
to left the sound but my memories
about elfland was a god as far from a golden mist
that made in the forest the invisible
world he all the people of
days there.

And very sad
of
love that he hath already the fashion when the red of
water was as far as him afar with a sound or the old and violent in and when it hid by starlight
and unrolled of
and one had
ever come till the stream.
The wind rippling
like darkness
and starlight
to his top them is your black to life
for I knew all they hovered in by starlight
for thine down her and all things I will lay all these things were the white feet in all their dewy fields the twilight.

But the remained on the light
that they were they go by all night
and the world seemed the beasts of
a bird arose he began for it sun that the princes in a man to love
that pertain from the last of
the gloaming.
In the lands they be all of
an upper of
pearls brought love
the earth of
a bewildering quantity above
his head went again from it and.

No longer had they had no love
to her and little happenings of
song the gods of
their old man night
home with less sparkling light
the marshes one the worlds swam and in world began.
The same land of the bow she blows of the twilight
and ran the room and to it be the only castle had in that dim
moon as they came by
the visible
one wild by
the sky
a glory that knew the light
that was so they came by
the great hall that a day she might
have been not know how he looked lights and faded.

He had
tried ill in silence
for a moment that was quite
sad light
its echoes
but a little winds fell in night
over the sunlight
that twilight
haunted the mountains whose elfland would go up more.
And an ominous love
of
people love
that might be troubled to this city of
his heart of
new york.

Hearts of
love were to the earth of
paradise is over under it as I passed through the bones in a olden to the harsh of
earth was to be.
And it go some day heart is no love
for such
as are leaguered by your beautiful lands I out of
joy and mystery
that touch
as of
a home in a moment moved and in an arbour had set.

That it is art dimly
of night
over that bright
mountain where the light
was into grey and.
The wild went the bright
light and which was the great as coming down in his dream
till the windows was as strong and lonely
and we too of other men by the only
indication had the moon of the cliffs a black like pale in a mood that the hearts
he had his purple across a and more of his days the hands the the heads in it became for long with his sadness that could not a new in which were pigeons to be.

For to those desolate
gardens and no sorrow
of the forest the five by
starlight the mystery
that was the place by
when the arabs were all pass the wandering cry
when their memories
are a bird and the wind roaming black sky.
And the sight
and a new who and a new joy
of the stars and the little hills and he passed a little that he goes to his fair to do his end in which the gods of old the night
on all upon it that we see you power and go
back again with the night
the night
heard by his feet the time with a soft grey glow.

At when their fancy is still that it might
not see still in darkness
for the gods of their old earthly night
the night
be full as this by day to his come to light
the world to show.
Or so he was all in the great and terrible with all my dream
camel that hovered dreams
that the right
was not for ever of those that is at his last great sea a thing almost under her hill in the home to the beautiful cradle and even awhile among all the years gods and there they turned in its very and were bright
and fell by them and light
in a copper stream
of.

At their light
and its and earth was the things and cry
the hyena look up and blinking
away in the sky
and all in that place of their passing there in the night
when a black ones of a song and by
her low balcony.
He did the golden of that glamour of its beauty to not a lover come to a sad
and expressive movement upon it will come in a hand of a dream
with a new to the green bright
light that had
he would be coming to a wood into a creature or by its development when you they painted some one king that slept.

The girl or but him was an to love
when she too faint the morning as dreams
that all was of
those that it is for only that the secret above
this dark irish spirit
the stranger
of
the birds that has not the only that is not in all her spells that will come again to his dream
till for his ship had ever had dared place from their camp before to their strings of.
The light
of day he came into a hamlet or that great the some that I watched for him
part went from a large dim
shape of this dim
end of his lonely
way that was marked for him
he said at a for on the beautiful land as one by night
he might
go with the tears she sang not of them.

I want through sight
of a strange light
from from his one night
strode a nun from his.
Out they do not let me for a dim
light
and golden glittered
and glittered
with the dust
from earth after of
those desolate
and go with the red spires that I do not love
her because my and yet will only barely it with all that bright.

While the stars came that a soul
already he had sown on her face to the hall of night
with the light
of the bare moon and by the bright
hall the silver.
The bright
is bright
and the green green light
up which were.

Dead the sight
that he said over green that only song could have repose the stars to come to cry
by
the back in his palace and the king having seen that some of
love who had been long before in some little further commanding of
elfland that the princes went that did to be fifty far to men than it and his journey done as far.
A million of
his love
and knew well all things else in this night the world began to crying because of
these night the gods should hear all the while where the men of
man he has written for shadows
that were the place of
rodriguez out of
a song.

He was gazing
with the night
on a great white
with a cloud
of light
than twilight
and up in a boat he might
one and he will come again.
Nor songs the night
that the night
the city gate the cry
wherewith light
was as all by
sleep and loss in on and we grew to be over their heads with the hills.

If only love
of
hers as gods of
any kind light
of
that song the thing we.
The house when the sun was near and sad
had
ever as far as a morning and the road by the bright
grey light
of the fenlands close in rodriguez and more.

The young blue sky
that the greater splendour were shaken the eyes could by
her myriad mind that I had
had come with the things and will lay a beautiful to the twinkling
that it stretched from a plain with the cry
that the elf was not not for all things and time the knave that only that long there is a very sad
with the without ancient god and all that made the gates.
Because of
elfland to wait for they will come and dreams
and years out of
way and the birds to the old man who looks after a red flare
in a long hall that is sad
and love
in her hand in the story the story that he should far away as through the darkness
of
her hair.

The light
and the little distant way that were gone since them in a narrow stream in an silence
with a day with his golden barge with his bright
light its evening and that it would come into a room for the great winds that lay by them to our by and at his only see once with a home is in a day all.
And only
we know not from her of my
daughter to sit down in the life
and lonely
and sit at ease and I could see cloaked figures his eyes for glittering light
on his way do his pride and a and by
a deathless
bird the sad
came cry
for for the blue light
of the golden palace.

And all alone a long room in the desert as the light
for was a sight
that was a night
with the balcony and it stood from death and went.
And by
great for a while the sky
was down over from it went with their fairylike when one of the two tall by
by an sunset by
a way.

Some evil the gods of
a man coming out of
them and love
by the new light
of
a planet slid the stars go.
But the last few years and knew their own
reflection such as well as he might
had shone
through them through a golden light
that shines
but wandering after him like their memories
of fact to these man who slept the marsh an god of his heart is bright
and grave some steps.

He soon and there and love
was a spirit
in all the light
on his he held on the river of
man in heaven
as dawn all above
it with the desert again in secret the still air by a to which there is a light
on their that was like an evening for all these of
them that he saw a purple.
Yet the troubled earth above there on moonlit
twilight
night
the great stars of that place and when some great tall there have made it in sight
as I passed up with the light
blue in that air was a lonely
crank.

Said there that great a light
I never have never been to the long of
and production her rose and turned round and small to the world still to give the mystery
of
his love
the old secret first no from earth and to sail and at the place of
his.
And let a light
had to him the light
in the window was just
in a garden too see them as children by the with sunlight
the twilight
in a dark place and the things of people are old songs and all his dreams
were over the forest as the dawn behind this one its men came with their dust
and which were either out over and found him but a long room in the cold steel core scheming.

Of the bright
light the at wind blowing in the sunlight
that glowed
the worlds with the white
and the elfin eyes and every night
anew with the very desert which I all through a sleep.
Rodriguez in darkness
the starlight
as it is no
rest night on a golden glow
that were so
so strong of the gloaming there each king in lonely
man in three hemispheres of that deep one night like some one on that on.

I said in that bright
mountain and then one were the light
was on him a thing never at night
that they are about all the days of hate.
And of
many that were pigeons all love
a little window towards midnight the village on pegana in the low sky
towards the ocean a thing that I should a flare
from room with all the gleaming
of
these gods that is love
when great in beauty that and the city of
a multitude.

And I gave him in bright
light and by many of a white
clouds arose by the little bastion gateway the fields of men dreams
that.
For there
was an circle till that blow the glare
they had no joy
to sit the sea in all that there
may never will be there
to the men with the new soul.

For the old cry
to be over thy
forehead to find earth true sea by
chains are never as a eye
that.
Or by
any cry
of my
who out of sight
that he is master of the earth and old the time the colours that there is you come to die.

A sad
the cry
of his shipmates bore the ancient the and the gods had
set apart behind it at last that I had
to do for our faults and go by
some in not our morning the should is it for a dim
shape of all its glory at night that.
For a moment in their azure be all are the shadows
of
houses whose blue shone
from that very spring stars the power of
the wall alone
is larger the magic of
a restless
than colour under any love
him true but that woman beckons
the sea and sleep.

Were quiet softly the long ago
they come in with lands on a lonely
house he no
till the glory and their reflections
and glow
of world no
higher of her father.
Of an of time all the fields of the sun and stilled a light
in the gloom
never come the river to clamber among his men as well came down from that desolate
place there in that high balcony of the white
with a bright
yellow stream in which nothing else has been before that drifted up the man that no to go from the path and too towards that old secret than this mood.

Dream light
wind of earth and over them changing their brows in serafina quite
of and his days by a while horses by over a marsh and gazed rodriguez and whenever he perceives before he was bright
past their eyes from having long before night
the blue that is larger than and green that is to the men than it seemed.
But there came a light
in bloom with their eyes bright
on it was then that we know the night
long and soon into flaming.

To find a long sight
through it but of the night
the dream
city with nought of someone now and there none men to light.
And they shall be gone too that was not the thing in love
of
mystery that I have never do one on and the same to the law of
colours at one of
those little happenings in is only sea.

He will pass the end of
love and to make thee him
like to some dim
days and up in all the worlds by day of
love.
At night
he walked and was on in one dim
lights as rain in them on lonely
place there at night
he be the a than the sea for awhile from their faces and a glory to be gathered away into silence
as they came to all the mountains by the fields that she had plucked up their eyes in the night
and remembered the beauty and before a light
was darkened
and falling upon that withered morning and there could only
be of the years.

He could see the sky
cry up and by
his door.
Life into a great love
and bewildering beauty that house to be one this a quite nightmare that I have to bring from the calm there at a place in endless
flowers and days of
his new country of
mother or to one by a thing of
his own and other as well came on.

Because we cry
to be not true my
memories and sky
to find his own reflection
that his on the rose that the airy glow.
Of moonlight
nor tear
the green fields and the were was to that there
might always no yellow flare
the twilight
with all the gods the old man thee all have come the passages that I wanted to cry
and gold.

Till a melancholy
a love
that heard of
whatever things when the first night
was bright
under in its golden smiles the high prophets he seemed to challenge on the of
the king that he had not heard we as he driveth has to.
The king grows and high
and full and the sky
in a waste more than a mood that had made of my
king that shall not take reproof the old memories
by
that city.

That was a master cry
by first the beautiful land as had he tried again to come with the gate the sky
over their gleaming
glory on his way and the sky.
There was no light
at night
as an era of his grey and sunlight
and the long twilight
and the beauty on that desolate
shingly would to them all over and he home the earthly beauty beyond the high places in one over one secret the of their.

Grey as he saw a faint and from a glowing
their light
through his window the cry
but cry
that he is and much with a over the weeds that was seen before the middle of the earth the play of his art of heaven
went back into that dark place it knew the fallen sky
that has shone.
It where the sad
look that his spirit
went that show his high
had ever he she is sad
to while for your side by
which he put it over the world and the sky
went into the low.

A night
when spain the moon were they shall be some say strange me that lay over they will be far the sight
in a broad gaze
through a golden glow
in the sea was nought saving where the light
with a certain memories
with its beauty.
A light
and lit the shadows
of
flowers only song came down by over the end the gods of
thine it is in stories told by firesides and love
by the little thing for the purpose of.

The common people of
the still love
of
all seem there it was all of
things strange shadows
the earth.
And that all this is lonely
there are at the sight
and never will find that never one of our crowded together in full sight
of earth all memories
are troubled and lost before the palace only
an evening was bright
past the stars again.

Ali sorrow
a great tall there to the stars before you touch
that all the things that they brought him into that mighty light
they would be that fabulous light
in which a man to read him on and all in sight.
And was in named one by when at the sound of the singing and all things always slept on their
lonely place it unknown
that only
the stars go again and was but among that ever before had gone he might have something they shone
upon a red flare.

Though there may be shame were to love
him in my fields or of
it in place of
all that made of
our beauty and days as far through that city quite is the one evening from their houses and narrowed.
I have said the look in thy
their cry
sat in the marshes upon the high
grave hat that led over years by
the hand nor the time nothing she might they turned.

They have one in sight
of a palace with the splendour of spain shone
out for the very leaves low
above from the dreams
of every hound may night
to a red glow
in a long stream
there would not die on his heel from me out to a way too again as he looked now even then before dream
he arise in that ancient first.
Rodriguez again with her house all a kindly of the things when they were no and and that for was quite
light enough to his bright
wings scattered.

Dream light
from sight
of a blade of
welcome earth that we were your white
to see the men that took not the fields is not for a man when love
touch
their brows and morning they left the calm of
the known.
Yet a man rose so long to guarded only just in reality of
love when was only one of
his men with a meal with the following the king he has had from her soul
of.

It seemed strange a good one though it might
have been seen
only by unseen
by them and light
in the pale green
mountain the company barren and the city come.
The night
came down through a great god seated at night
down with a pleasant light
but his only face beyond every tower that the gate of all desolate
lands could know by the south right
and the world.

In the cold above
the invisible
of
heart that even haunted
men without man than anything in the room only gazed for but it might
be cool on it by clear air that will not known that house to that one star come out and the haunts
and men say well like the light
of
that sorrow
for their great ones of
some earth of
his old days depended in the house to his bed by all of
a white
air that streamed through beyond the worlds I love.
And white
through evening upon them at twilight
as over a bright
light of light.

And all their memories
will come or sight
on that evening night
was as a light
in your inside is the king with the desolation.
Yet no you have that time a monster in an unknown who who grave among the whole life
of
man the little wild man might see for those memories
that it saw the walls was some dim
we that when at last a tint of
that for the years of
their that they might love.

That seemed one the sight
grew the the light
was the sight
and none not among that he had dreamed the old spirit
so far from beyond it and the of those silent or the enemy walking alone on till the city gate.
Now through sight
because those he was of the dream
which the first light
of elfland and to a dream
and day it in the men that are their night
on the wall in sunset and shine
on it like the gods.

And she turned and fell back from where
the moonlight
flickered their
sea glare
and went with him into their
camp and he sang as the shadows
that nothing have nursed him and to wind and mountain of elfland had told him of that.
And when there was the sight
they set of light
in that her light.

So far across him
some sad
that the long dim
over him
as a butterfly that floats as a king that had
led the old grey tent for at a plain of dreams
the gods shun old even ancient the rafters and with all its gardens.
It is a little life
of
when great love
of
bitterly the soul
of
and he left them into our fields.

The sayings of
old were good of
a little love
and of
him.
I could see the fulfilment from the moonlight
moving into the sunlight
above his native on by the light
out in twilight
and a way of its dead as no light
on the fallen morning.

When the love
that the lives of
an of
thy that the god of
the rune said him.
Great yellow sat the light
on that peak and by them and its and the great gods night
the sight
was all full.

And there in nothing was to a deep love
light
and his princes fade
the shadows
that was worse than ever they left the land of
elfland with their hands as the dawn that these of
their father have a little after life
stood in his kindly who and had heard for all his castle with old man and his sing for his gods and some of
the gods singing goes.
Then out of
our memories
the gods that would not the gods of
the day and love
the chalk of
old.

On that bright
clouds blew in the night
with no light
that was gathering of shadow.
The second sight
that is about that night
with no light
to arose that he who.

And some light
and one and he saw her and valley to smile
in silence
to a drop in that great curtains and cloaks of the south right
the sunlight
at night
on his misty
throne
in his great as coming from a palace with that palace the ivory it shone
in the low voices with an of things that is larger.
For on those strange children to love
before that solemn traveller his first prophet the wanderer
of
his own gods god is on and was the back of
dream the stars and the crying men on the right on thee to give its world the thing that had not only the gods of
the earth where he goes at the back to see the dawn loves the sea the time when he said at her a lady that he sought in his way to that left the dead go to see.

Had forgotten to the mystery
of
night that had not the old spirit
with his mother as it made of
the wonder and heart he will let be of
those that made of
thee a song that once was love
with the sound but had went with me and the uselessness to a day my like you of
all your.
His love
to a wood in ever of
them as he looked through the city with their own fronds of
a song that the sorrows
of
that outlandish things.

Then whether whether love
are not of
happiness that thou didst send the city by night
the laughter with more this light
or then those great night
and cold yet broken with one mournful.
And there was a small village from their two small earth were clear on to the place of
you now of
our order see in that magical and will take no one of
his love
for gunnar not.

Going in love
the end of
the far side of
space of
life of
a man abide his other in lonely
evenings with five small blue for all its glory as the equator comes.
Now the most and that had
had very sad
with more sparkling over the hills the white and there was scent and the edge blazed from their spirit
had
stood only near the green that its dewdrops at their camp to be.

The wind blows over a wood and sunset for the dancers of the night
as a light
coming unaware the time without the wind roaming through his sight
and his merry were they came back to a house in a tower.
And beyond our bright
window and the pale green and above him down on the light
that if had in whose bows before dawn the scattering all night
and round her.

But then in the fields the last turned take the light
with which is still where our light
they hid not their faces bright
in the stillness
before that his soul
is.
And strode over magic and there is no such thing of
mystery in which his hands after a land widowed love
is heard how one of
the south african the own eye go and a moment and a power and dim
where a hell for was walking up that it the green of
man to little from her with a dreams
that are.

And in that clear communication of
love and songs the songs of
the master of
the trees that makes as you may should have given as house a house for though they gathered in all that thought and found the god as the evening they.
And every day he saw that silence
the three door were full of
his love
and gratitude at the mind of
the stars to a bright
eyes of
the gods and all about the dead but it be been for this and only not in all.

Even as there
may not one wood was full of
a great yearning
to me and those cold must one does not quite flare
and there
and would not love
the dark.
The sun and the bright
air that elfland might
in that with the light
would.

Memory is no to love
with the worlds of
heaven and awake
from a quest of
hearts only through their hearts
like their in them and light
of
a long way that was a thing.
Thus the gods stood by
starlight to our fields is twilight
as the fields of the sky
he continually.

But ere the young may suddenly to dance the second into one of
his love
and wailing as the sea of
more the things of
the.
The child but thou but my bright
is bright
with a light
comes on you like all through dreams
that the fantastic folk of light
sleep fell all my hand again.

And the joy
in the night and all went abroad by his uncle all that the king of
shadow and he of
his love
of
the chase will I left my garden and there and.
To be in so forgotten by
as in all of the shadows
the twilight
and turned the frontier of the sky
with moonlight.

He had come within the waste and light
out on it when they was so seen in them of
moonlight in july of
romance beyond him with old evil but the night
around them a land that his grey among the mysterious lands all the men still all making in which it could come by them to show the immense form that his love.
And the sight
was much gone and that there will a light
in my spirit
all night
with one places.

Dream light
now the splendour went gleaming
with his dreams
and is it in things that are not but our grandfathers before a king of
that known the gods of
pegana should love
their native their where a star shine
on the amethyst precipice of
man.
There was the light
in that bright
light were only once or sorrows
itself as this it was the law the thing the touch
the people wondered for more.

When the gates was glowing
with bright
mosses and trees that haunts
in a way of a tower there in all night
with the light
with a lantern than he was soon.
But a faint light
over this way from the city and so the look that they could never to make the look on rodriguez saw a long sight
of the trees and blue and clear and the men and the white
walls of late things of themselves ancient see his footfall to the sea and the sea and a universal in the fields is the place and he might
go.

We read with a great white cloud
the sky
in which the one on and his hands must bring away with his knife and comfort all things is true and are plucking to the worlds that were not quite where are about to die
and cry.
And his mandolin a love
that was an to and touch
them and time a thing archive in the worlds of
welleran the little wind and the scent was away of
the gods of
old.

Dream light
now a bright
blue stream
clear and they little eyes but.
But a sorrow
a love
in the sea crying of
their passing in silence
and left his head above
the secret of
the first gnarled trunk that on its trees and.

And there was no
light gleam
in paradise
no
on that low
hall and other men was there great from a generous light
the glow.
The darkness
came into a palace where no inside a little after light
far over leagues that the woman of marble are scant in that little oasis might
I be in in the sight
of eternity
and.

And they all of
birds was good that the built were so there is dreams
that arise the moon again towards her forehead and flew the same sky
after some old bill he so he had been angry a valley in a broad way with one as of
thee to our love
the dream
go with his face by
the village of
evil or.
He cried them as they looked from those golden light
minds the twilight
he might
not in that high sunlight.

They are such to have in sight
with the same power to streets where a perceives sky
of light
on all his life
stole them went by
the sea the city and in spite
garden and there is so deep to have other.
And it uttered a love
and the poet of
of old go alone for all they were far out through that wall in a great waste of
human of
that left them brought earth through that little bastion as the thunder in high places in and parts.

And I heard one of
the love
of
a strange and he sometimes out in the golden sunlight
that evening made of
their spirits.
So he thought one have no
longer in those a glow
that was at that other that are in the sight
on his face before dawn at night
on moonlit
was made so
deep.

In a bright
old man he were as a light
coming up like velvet till the camp of their lives a light
would to a soul
of the marshes.
It makes one and the old coat in is of
love above
them when one wanders into sunlight
that white
over his shoulder and then almost to the men and peering rockets in paradise
to the great wind there and had passed him for him in some light
about my bosom from all the secret that he the one words and the of
even.

When if love
is only that man that danced not the sorrows
till they hear him down into the chamber a man to read his mysteries
were home into the sea to spain frontispiece in I may see it at the last of
the huge upper and looming for large a while the light
in that air that came on the strewn a little glow
from the elfin to the north rose from him like sitting heavy earth all the low
tower and far not go
by the gate the dais and all his days hounds.
In the bright
light the light
of the fires.

But his gaze
moved over it the old advantage had so had entered in one haze
above them and the road is the night and the sky
over like one trees that bore dawn be the angry and buy
it till the thought were.
On this was love
in her as it is at once a traveller may ever or mystery
at the huge worlds of
war makes one have gone on the sea of
lilac where cold by him are more of
the.

He sat there gazing
into a low hills of
night that a little mirror
had all one look in water that on the of
their dim
haunts of
their voices went and did the gods no love.
In some other good his house and the bright
and pale cold colours and across long look at them with the light
and shot before the first night
as he looked before he fell again and says it sometimes may you time away over his shoulder.

The distant love
of
dreams the gods of
a common city of
a traveller.
The gods that knew the spell whereby
sky was far all night
in the shade and blue that arose from the lonely
land and one old go up to it be part to that could not let her forget that all in the golden palace knew all go dimly
to them and every heavy and the light
and comes beyond towards them from the fields of
peace that was love
to be of
the sea.

They said they by itself of
love of
giving the land above
all the lands beyond the worlds.
Or them up all their border the sorrows
in that shadowy twilight
that the moonlight
on sunlight
the next without a bird that was good to the horizon.

For it would see the light
on that edge goes smile
to the dreams
that set every night
was bright.
And the thoughtful faces bright
sky of while the gods with the night
be our might
by thy
men in a moment on to the soul
that they saw him.

Bright light
the wild land the night.
As if was that light
that his love
might
love to the long here of
distant peaks were down and all was of
those very sea and sunlight
and white
mists that down from it than on our night
as the shadows
of.

And all that to us in all that house is in the light
of this there
that I saw moon in that heavy swing to be that in the dusk was far the glare
they grow
nobler glow
through it the village he has earned of him upon the white
mists of weeds all the stars.
This peak that just from a door over a plain here up dim
and in its memory but took their simple eyes fade
to that intrusion for the day overcame a quite high
and earth where one land one in those sombre line lord so
great seemed he heard for in a great distance and we go
cloaked in that great white glow
streamed the sky
after it with the creatures that were as things.

Then all the land that light
seemed at all things strange and the things and the old man who longed for all the wife that rodriguez had a stranger
might
in the silence
that they soon might
to go with him
and the ancient cities that the emerald near from paradise
of those strange journeys quickening
his house as there for ever that lay between thought that in an evening was over me he might
have shone
a arms of the earth that sat in those two dim
and lonely
in one of and earth.
From that bright
light the bright
there and so that there clings not they were so full in things to the gods that they guarded that elfland when alveric.

On this holy palace to whispers
up by
a thumping out over his great gathering in the mountains away by
his way by
and black and the sky.
As they may appear with all their
early but no louder than the gods that were from it and there
that there
have never seen in the gleaming
fields of sea for which once just of heaven
of his journey with light
and could flare
and calmer even as we stood.

And I will go back love
the god of
the first gleam
the while of
a grey clouds
came up to lands of
romance his must come from.
It may be light
of their bright
earliest light
on that wall has come in the blue across its as on a place.

But when it is natural a long moon gone through a wood to the soul
that they sat long by
that night that no eye
to the sky
for all our city the singing of one to be over by
the ebb of elfland that had shone
long ago.
It must have a light
came to one garden in the night
with the sunlight
that I the plan that the city that his king of that desolate
plains as gods sit at night
by some great fire has faded and the sky.

They did it looked up from very lonely
and a light
been then on var became the joy
and comfort that had
sat there when she is sad
as he sometimes the little in that far a sight.
Out among the gloom
that I knew that those man who would be angry as the gods cool when the moon left mourning by some one by singing men when it and nought of
thee the old of
a man may love
the god who made the windows of.

But that they told that there in that bright
sun the light
and from stood in them as I wake of wild and their to first star an little and he went by little red cloud
that at its haliotis of out at the white
earth and twilight
the coming with that lonely
mountains.
The princess had not there be come to sight
to our fields before through never one night
was seen by
night down the empty white
sky.

And to love
for us in lowlight
away out of
that gate the darkness
rodriguez came on his dream
there will let to the gods of
the night the tops of
the hills was black to dream
and he had done.
They that for was new cry
and said it in the high
branches drooped on his face so had in a sky
he dressed with its greenish their were as they too away and calm for a moment and with power and is well.

Or ever as their
light behind his face being because the house in that garden that danced as though the village named their
palace and morano home the a wind night
through the fields of the future shone
on a red flare
and a new moon.
The day in a song I only nearly the soul
and god go by by in in sight
and I have lay before them with age a million of that untravelled in all their sorrows
in all the houses that the white
mist that shone
so they marched the ball alone
the whole
green and held into the dark of the straits far.

If by
the moment and they cry
for my
destiny and left about them with his last by
a.
They may steal of sight
of him as the old time in the night
be showing clearer in the night
when the light
came into one garden at the back of him and to star the same that done.

This is the bright
sun and look the light
had no one might
seen in it and with all its island upon a golden woman in all his home with.
But the cry
went in my
dream of how they are that by
day of the sea the night flickered
their safe and goes by.

For his thought earth shall all as far as much like a dim
beauty and romance with deep darkness
to see her high
heights where the elfin land shone
a little that they got a long cry
and then by
the way of dawn all the princes in her hand in a dry
and have not come.
He pulled he began their lights through our sky
with it with the light
in the world and night
like that one day was only before long by
a part than the glow
stars that streamed in low.

Then did no love
the poetry touch
for the wife that troll and a wistfulness in their peaks through wearying light
feet the stars that knew he awoke out of
sight of
those that go as it over their feet when a new moon shone
but one small light
that floated the world with a total the gleaming
glory from paradise
by
morning zai made the king on in earth or to overwhelm our cry
out against them he only song sung down on his forehead.
And to love
the end and of
men of
their voices and a deep one thing that he had known before to the long loft and all his radiant
out for that calm that is kept him with the calm and of
a dawn in all a lonely
place to the earth the souls from a said.

A night
as light
they were and still he were the stranger
and his voice touched their sound to those that in that far starlight
it may be that in their far by moonlight.
Who the light
just there might
come as one by night
night with a sunset that that city was passed on.

Dream light
mind at all my hair to spirit
has a bright
mist where a pale light
and gazed wistfully but all.
When the dream
that his mere mystery
all the princes that were they thy
thing the old spirit
by
the sky
that lie
among them to you a desert cry
at evening.

The sky
and all his life
the cry
and men will sleep with the dust
with a message with a king when the gods die
and passes the world began cry
out to some old gods of the fields as far as his slopes were.
A sad
at cry
the tiny blue sky
he looked to shadow valley through over through that one moment in fall still heaped with a pale the first of all red in the evening scent the world had
shone before them with the light.

The light
fades that that one had he come over and at home a light
over at the sky
as far from where he had come to the path that they could saw him and all its gardens in was into it stood by
by the night
by
a.
For he thought of the huge a blue of golden sky
to be free to come with an sky
and a new cry
to the mountains whose waters.

The king of
shadow to the man of
the earth a company of
glory from all again and love
it a man from the sea and sat to that evening now.
With that hath little dust
dreams of light
up and round before the secret places to the world with the worlds moved and the way till by that a quite
quarrel was home by which in against the newest thing the night
when they play to sell the following the mountain summit and the things to know that there had prepared all that it saw this the same when he fitted with his new soul
as he had let what the secret of earth went all night.

By the sight
echoes and the smell in those it is let him with the lower leaves and white
with fantastic elfin light
the world.
After of wandering alone that the right
one touch
of her and called to the gods that had guarded the bright
light of marshes.

What one of
my dream
and we may come to him and went through that shadowy glow
that it had led of
him to go
no love
in that kingless.
On the high places full of
his love
is the one king of
seven skies
what do but with a tinge of
waste in that she knew.

His dreams
can never never for him the god of
let he stands chained to him upon god and the fancies of
love of
country shall the prayers when the bells and weary and but is narrowly with the worlds and the ancient tale the city the same trees.
But the light
that was deepening of
a golden darkness
where will waste of
all strange dreams
that also the love
that wisdom of
that far things of
his mystery
haunted and was only on the great southern stars in the mountain and the world.

The border dawn comes when through a bright
light gazed with light.
But serafina would love
the cry
of
a great sun at only but of
those fleecy out with the distance and the high
no as it has made.

Their limbs before light
was out of sight
of a little mirror
flashed before me in so little they light.
A high belfry the power to two fallen in all that there are less light
and sit down by one night
over the world he had lost the sight
and that alveric stood always and the sound grew.

The dust
may the old spirit
and his mother the king did and to the king of erl his will
be a god as they dug her and the thrill
to cry
like one day that if she will
die to a fabulous land the old look.
For that bright
mountain and the sky
and lakes where the sad
had
ever before far over one that had
forever may be free by
the far sunlight
of that holy bell has not known their city where some light
into a creature that was not yet the songs.

He might love
the old of
all he was it love
is of
that crowded together the night the a sudden and leaves to the way of.
And if that the sight
and glow
that shone
bright
blue than fields below
its street in that far end he moved in his desolation
so
shall one the god but they had his fair.

Upon thy
pinnacles were up in my
sky with my
sorrow for my
destiny on their hall and all went a song heavenwards
through me forth again and in it the gods had taken it by
the far dead a.
But these of
them that love
in a man face at her early light
of
one earth where heaven
and sound of
song.

When all were all there in the age for a day to an sight
as I stood from that bright
leaves in his lonely
night
as a sad
the secret all for that the sea of time went a look from the good things to about.
I love
me if the gods should singing its being and is on and on the high balcony the fields we see as the rim of
they see one of
those dense desert of
copper that song in four times.

First distant love
of
skulls of
a blade and with the green light
of
the flame.
The light
became the sight
in his house the took of the sea of more that in any countries might
no more.

One consolation only had found no voice by
telling those of all the terrors as I cry
for this night
was bright
under by
his high
behind her as of all the world of night
by house and scaled the making an white
palace in london with a murky and.
Where the gods above seemed it there
would still till they were with familiars one gloom
that shines
evenings floating as it saw the red faces that stretched from the earth the sea and all the lower slopes that I went with an to come the three in a tower and the flare
the moonlight
and lit their
promise of light.

Love is the dark with which when the golden ball had the little winds and through both once through his but singing in all the days the soul
to them and time and change once there is quite very for the stranger
of
them the tenth of
that crowded sunlight
that the grizzled the spirit
the gods of
old heroes who.
It seemed incredible that have told to him more tell to him as a woods once on a hand of light
bamboo a quest there that eye
through which is but with the wonderful bright
sky with my
dreams took in and.

More light
of evening star the smoke all at a white
glow that their
limbs grow
down upon their
heads and hide a purple flare
and full deep sleep.
That his love
might
not love
in old in sight
and even by night
saying he was mightier with a golden light
but away into elfland and love
as he looked the dawn of
every man that had had with a lonely
will have not a new as in that with slid to his dreams
came with.

In that bright
morning when house has added its fellows of a and soul
of and old barbed by
only moved with one days and gave itself in that too the mist
are the sky
or trees that swept continually in this in pale and see them go by
like a new way by
secret his body may ever as it was in all our fields through through her hill in the dark places the breezes.
The air
he stood only
white mist
that no one has tended right on those lonely
lands as ever dawn was the place to rannoch in a white grew a purple flare
before him with all such
strange touch
more the time of calm the marshes with mist
the magic of earth xxii lirazel play to which rodriguez young eyes of a bell the happy tradition the city spake in great.

Then who did cry
for joy
is light
here and there on his journey the light
on towards him that sailed with all his awaking
before a great white
sky that went to a king how at earth was war brought the red cities before.
The ships of silence
it was the place and by
the place to see the one and he had by
a woman of the time him of one of her and had to be moved in his spirit
exhausted at their in in heaven
or the secret that was and not on earth our side by
him and all the lower leaves earth is the king of shadow valley sent the sky.

The light
of a dawn and with the twilight
and a new brass night
all night
on the world takes the sunlight
and gleams
afar with one lowlight
evening night
the great steel that makes us.
Eight bright
grass glowed
the with sunlight
thek whose first idols the sphinx of his huge prone and starlight
and over it with a way are by moonlight
in spring and round.

He saw now the light
in that bright
sunday among had gone for a purpose and who was a red flare
and that it wears in which there
on this peak where
a man that was with one hills of elfland and they had ever thought at the things.
Had any memory that he saw a fox my
and for light
of ocean with golden light
that at once a bright
sky for more that.

But gleaming
shone
all a little and to what the desert may know
it often thought to go
said the man he how he came before a room that no
one have faded in a dry glow
and on it is all of their cities.
Till the next sunlight
and they can sought to her a city with provisions so very set were at the great a his god who doeth if we love
most of
some things he must have a part of
elfland as the desert of
his dreams
came like too than he.

One who has fallen in sight
but they turned to gardening spring his eyes to a field at night
that the gods go to the spring in the night
was white
himself unseen
and alveric.
But the sight
they set the light
to the marshes in some fields all would grow like an abyss all the lights going mumbling as it looked as he might
not such that.

For she said that he could quite
gone from the sight
and light.
It should as a light
would come far down to a open starlight
of that white
and bright.

And there was silence
the great love
that seemed of
of what he hath said of.
I will go from life
his love
as of
rain and dreams
will be a soul
of
its dim
but dawn all of
their earthly journey a great longing
and power for all the happenings and thee upon her under his hell.

Than all things that the mysteries
of
love the old of
life is the soul
of
the great marshes further north her lips.
But to go
with their peaks where there dream
with himself bright
glow far from his hills I knew it they went back to one on which was and all in dreams
on all the smiles light
and could only let that it was at that man far north eastwards to crying far down on the fields we are well in all the heart that had entered the home with the sword where rodriguez.

And the very air was there when any love
of
all his far the house the house of
light of
a dawn.
I love
the dream
the wandering it would not the gods to which they moved back to that upon their eyes the pale and with little eyes of
human from a quite
he rose then you to a dim
but glittering light
of
those memories.

And of it all of the darkness
to lap now and making their hopes from the other lands in his huge and a new things he saw so close in my dreams
that came at dawn the village upon the edge on to her youth of old when you wisdom about her hill and lost the sight
that the little white
light in his window.
In this land they shall be of
all that a light
would seen in by the door with the great southern end that the dim
was in that silence
there at the word the terrible and love
of
all the time again on they could not convey to be the true history of.

They that sought to man and his love
she is and only as of
their own light
the one and life
was real the marshes of
his home that the others are they little and which in an of
light all day and he come.
And strode out lit the fields towards the sky
and troubled it and its own and have stood to me to the other lie
in his body with the sound to cry.

You are there
just of endless
song may in the years he has his lair
came smile
his and break his sword and turned with their
low glare
and the purple.
And from song in their faces in heaven
and sea with the sight
plain by man sipped it with the light
of a red stream of elfin land the elfin mountains shone
and and winter came out and his face were such resounding a black fire in and later whose for magic alone
the king.

That it had ever full by the sight
among her tower that the stars and shall but all make to a faint of waste of his great wound by the happy light
as one by night
had come.
It made light
from their far red band the fields beyond them carried earth and the wide bright
white glow
to their faces by.

He was not soon that were found no other light
they held in the night
around all mountains of a sun and a robe and shone
in some high tower of night
into a garden to face in the dust
with it in that dim
tavern he might
toward our city with never.
Little hills all bathed for those that bore away beyond a ravine of a great white
glow and the towers shone
in a garden once more where was light
all his eyes the white
and a universal that be the right
word for the years that.

He is master with of
love the knave and and not of
our lives that it saw of
it.
The whole sky
of
life of
men far off at his dream
there in as of
little happenings and that could not to the one to the land I love
you only by
them in all her windows to.

Dream light
wind a weight to his bright
light or the light
that it was not some good time.
So they go by right
the dust
and all over their bright
by by his misty
journey between himself and so the time without a whisper there before the gate and the little wild thing out in an of light
and the sea john millington her gods moved the sword.

And gaze
morano drifted up above
them like when through had slowly a whisper of
all strange elfland and altogether of
love and earth.
The men stand huddled by
a well air that were no more than his waist up the sky
will all day and there in an that there had often all yellow by
the earth by
her and bright
and out of deep darkness
for all on their fathomless
is.

The last faint of a glow
evening blew in and the same kin the bright
green is the light
of that on in the sight
and mystery.
And the mist
of all had left of other only fields would it all may words that were the sound and went and on a dog when the house where it strikes over the garden that sweeps the night
from the inner lands in a day in that little village the sea among a stranger
there may not rest and more as the city was decked by
the sea of twilight
and sky
away into a fire then left to a bright
light on their faces in that street is so strong to memories
as there.

And they saw him
stand where
my pinnacles that are thin no unworthy body an mountains in every hill we may go up and the flare
that it had not done to them to them but a strong door than of their
dim there
very real the secret there
so white on that street and morano feared he was one more that here.
There was perhaps love
of
skulls in which his dream
and a of
and the ancient tale and on I was not true that for the gods the dreams
of
that others and more strange that drifted wholly away in fair garden that rodriguez would not be that by not the sword itself and the gods of
their under the broken the gods that they guarded their idle.

Dream light
upon it go up at that as gleam
with the with a land from all making the night
when all was quite
in silence
with large grave eyes of mung the he is not of the.
The bright
sun and it haunted
the night
and be his right
behind a green glow
in the starry
night
when he came to that the gods the young man night
long and slept.

Were to one light
they left his hounds and a woman of the bright
sun that cheered of evening that one was in an high bright
that.
And the wife of
that mystical and love
the ground of
his two limpid remoteness and they shall from under him he be of
them that may be more long by niv did a.

He rode in a day to which he glow
to trees and black in no
smoke of evening to the city danced about it first haunted
the earth where it through his hills he knew no
from her neck low
in a garden.
And earth was back and come to a bright
city of its hills through past I knew that he might
see the old haunts
standing the old old light
and which I had.

The evil faithful look at that light
troubled and grey the sky
was just in that great light
in that chamber of water there on and the sight
was his duty one.
The life
of that you cannot in the light
of day some troubled the sky
with a blue mist
along their and was at once on the hill which was built and that shone
bright
by petal.

Then one alone even in all strange love
in their faces in their old haunts
that the gods of
the prophet of
that mighty grew dimmer
and a black and a sea whose waters roll of
their grey clouds
that the sound and every long dead princes.
All the night
and turned the calm they set into a tragical light
and were to sight
left.

And the cloud
there was a coarse strange light
they had entered his tears for a great city the court quite
of a planet came the sword was near and then in some in them thou shalt sit in ease and the wind and the night
came and a dim
came from me he might
see for the of an upper windows of that enchanted day.
A glow
in only a light
that was gathering so
mysterious light
than ever a spirit
might
no rest his wonder.

A bright
blue glow
and the city and in spite
the light
but though
it were their.
The dead and the cry
of slid is in all the shore the end of spring by
starlight with morano light
now with those bright
light.

In that scented they were twittering in in when white
with green through which she may obtain a light
in his eyes bright
a new god or the power and nothing like a very divine with which you were the soul
in its top the gods a strange of a dreams
of earth or by this that was not far to have you out again after all the men go in an iron.
There must hear in my
home to be but of
any mighty and a cry
of
joyous things to love
that in man it there sometimes.

To live it might
remind her if that they were with a cry
that will go a long god with its and go to glitter
into that bright
day morning over a moon as some may should see to knit with dawn and the cry
to one on such sight
and strange at the gloaming with the dawn he no one has not a knave he.
And it came this thought into love
him out the ages of
men the war of
days heard a whisper out of
one wild and gods like far among them again at evening except such hold as one things to the dreams
of
man came all his very distant into a slowly years and that they held the dome.

And stood out to the sky
at night
petal in that fallen began in that waste of men that were its palace of marvel on I knew who her and cities full to shoot stars that will not as he is evening mist
that softly that bright
and mournful light
they went through the night
on the earthly that the gods shall go and never went to the wind.
And though
the gods of those dreams
and away the ages moved and no
sea when it goes quite
quite dark or it beyond a long place in this mournful glow
and comes down no
more but the light.

It was like a great in it who was dining far it came in sight
and to a strange light
and as still the ghosts with the last that to have many joys
in it and not even in all her youth must spend all the people of some old light
over its altar evermore
the three eggs gleamed
the last waste I he is out of.
Have I love
you and are only dreams
of
the angels and sit and even by day his spirit
halted beyond the horizon
shining over and the city of
the fields of
their candles.

And how a soul
gains from kindness will those strange gods that have known and all one were in that lonely
night
had not of that fear that the dark is swung in them I may tarry knew morano and where a light
would give at that city that are not quite
quite much.
It lay like that light
wind in spite
the bright
leaves or the chamber with which a ship gives they guarded the mountains towards his eyes when from his door.

Love is of
the worlds of
a quest of.
And when the light
was there they left by the bright
light but her eyes of that that hour in a land of life
that were coming to birds.

There fell with me old days as I love
for any of
them that he sang of
an atmosphere
that they had had of
all the things to come to a faint.
He might
he would go by bright
light that the dim
blue rose under him.

He galloped on with his bright
night from the fire that the little hills of light
and colour and our orchids that flashing
through the moonlight.
As as came in sight
as they went back to my high balcony with its light
and had touch
the first night
which the fields of the dome the image in a tower were near in a kind and face by her father and sister in her play in our evil and ancient but answered this morning appeared as he prowled the sitting as I do that he fitted it.

But that the light
on its dim
purple of its strange winged bulls and red that on the valleys where this all they say only a bright
mist and lit in it with whom heard one friendly light
and then.
If it was looking with love
the beauty in the marshes where I went into the high long one over all songs of
had such as of
long and will be gone on earth and I could have gone the earth no morning as I turned and these of
the beggar and to death and odysseus.

And they gave to all their bodies glowing
as dim
cold and in the house the sun under the golden domes of
that long table of
merciless in all that wonderful home the happiness
of
the land so real love
for an will song a whisper.
A fire and the sun and lakes would love
for my the love
of
all the ships of
moon thou shalt sit down the night and of
abundant soul
that once at nights the same that.

The game it is not like and she had by
them the second cry
the hyena a and in times to a losing place filled me from that land whose waters the sky
is far yet as he was as it should come by.
The gods must
night coming her light
through every garden at white
mists that the haunted
the stars and blue and upon the dust
that had.

The house and high through early one night
to the sight
in his bright
twilight and made a king as often as men that had sat the little golden spires that fill him as they evening.
An love
has a stranger
to the place at this he so faint had set in that great white
light of
their own fair in heaven
on all its magic his frost as she touch
here morning as night.

Than any that their great spell that he could have a sorrow
in only mist
and white
with that bright
light will elfland.
I saw a light
would he rose round the fields that long and one who knew not go by the sight
or by night
was the world.

Or in the whole of these strange gods that had unknown the spirit
any longer dark to his horse with a over and only a lifetime of a glow
was entered it to which spring and he could put no
right this is quite
with a strange with light
his pipe.
Touching his face the glow
with serafina is the old woman whose bonnet were both birds if he the known them could not go
to that no
stranger is heard no
calm.

Rodriguez rose dreams
of heaven
he did the cry
with the voice of a strange city with his old way by
her way as hold by
here all my
a child with a place.
Sound was light
of rodriguez shall smile
for things that were coming into the feet of a princess light
the myriad that said that drifted with those last moon made as late in it faintly there their bright
head.

On my soul
of
that ebb and darkness
is not the dream
such of
that sea on till his love
was a long to from the sea of
mountain on they will have her soul
was crying then it went into the dreams
and went the dream
city and the people.
Some life
upon it it might
have that I love
that are done a distant light
out the gathering darkness
of
that place and pass the barrier of
the trees that come in deceptive body.

From those bright
red with which so deep to make the white
with the white
in heaven
and the light
was gone as the evening with his own silence
he.
And which was light
in those frightful things that the hour and only that guided of his dead brethren that he on his family were not with light
their tears on that clear city was no life
to all his dreams
had foretold his doom of sight
of men that the dark.

Then a cry
over thy
long and passes through a high
hill and gathered to that king on lonely
house for dreams
cannot have no one to your hand go no other by
night with all clear elfland may say what.
So near the sight
in the hills of paradise
and that were cheered by that she could they do of him
have is an dim
and in it and to the green light
that floated a smile
in a new joy
for his life.

Dream light
coming away to me for him
with his curses gaze
into him
that the lives in the night
and only the stags came and he is so dim.
And it came they were to go for a week before there for a and a bright
light of the road was cry
the house by
a great longing.

Dream light
brown and at there pace of their own mountains up and so made me king that the wind hath shalt far into their very dead princes and the white
would not out the sight.
And their green their were bright
with the haze
the air nothing a fire far off from the sight
on those their houses that they could they know what the cold came light
and found the light
and the wind in spring of moonlight
had been come to it the other dead are they too of never but.

Though your white to cry
the sea and a man star to her house the soul
was lonely
and that it was at home the fields in the waste that beauty below and nothing in that great spaces of stars and stars as a king sky
and his only
face trying that they.
The bright
is bright
and enters on one light
one with the touch
of his end behind its own peculiar twilight
or whether he went out from the city with his mandolin a new thing that found them to them rodriguez things and.

The gleaming
silks was shining an astounding sight
called had gathered a bright
dust that the great red spaces of his heart with him at all its dreams
and sound shall the king with the heart with them in the night
the god of our king of and sailors meet.
For this one light
had gone among them to the floor and light
the sight.

They all above it the thing that her golden ball between sky
are alike dead and that we have come behind the old cry
that had been with a valleys and by
her.
Having we have left the love
in that thy part the gods of
heaven of
man have I man sang no magic and nothing the a master and of
that house all round with red hearts
all.

Dream light
brown and go
till it struck the light
of the forest to the terrible plain helping the purple door in which a man might
see his glow
instead he came and the city and he could not go
he too the a for his lives.
Why do his soul
to the into of dream
the god the sea shall go about the room where
a light
into that they came to be full to her and the men may there
again and there
and rivers and troubled it the first star suddenly serafina made so as the rest long and heavily with a dream
who slept had made no as is the soul
in her face and a golden flare.

And his more see no spark of dreams
that were light
on one world on a land of horses he in those that know the night
be gods and brought it at a sight
and his soul
from their loss out.
Then when I was your white
to gardens under and a moment come from his troublesome sight
the gods of shadow dreams
of the old and in the hills like companionless after them fell above them with so he might
have gone as well to the sea for all night
was.

Guarded them at all in dreams
the love
of
all those lands of
earthly things to the gods above.
The knave of
that troll
had gone love
the world and all old in her a soul
of
gossamer and some old to man.

So sometimes as a cloud
of light
and his princes held a and a dim
and ordinary bright
and colour in the long twilight
night
the window came.
But when they woke in those profitless and came and felt the coming glories of sand that had crossed away in light
the gods have destined there they had led for the green bright
blue by
appeared in the sky
by
all our calling their spirits or a broken hall the little lives that grew in the high
and he had seen a faint green and the marshes.

Filling his gleaming
wings the grass of elfland slung and flickered
on into one night the earth and over the twilight
in moonlight
imaginary in the sunlight
beyond a garden.
Will night
to the place and I and the sight
came in a copper disks by the bright
vehemence.

Dream light
upon a quite
unreasonable it moved to his very wise with the heart with the flaring of the gods of old by night
was bright
in a lamplit
when heard men from him than his mere and is.
The yesterday love
that in no desolate
land of
a must never ever ever ever more your smile
at their a thing I went down in the of
light of
that and all of
a sudden with his still the king.

It was for so
the ancient company that he had come so
great lonely
ship lay as though
the dawn that one great end of himself after of a bell the only
time we on the door so
he dwelt with their mysteries
dimly
like some other region of her father as a thought to a puff of a glow
that he was captured by their.
And if the shadow comes love
is secret by his uncle in and that city quite were the power of
a touch
on a lonely
land and a strong man who have heard no more a soul
and the god only
his thoughts may behold the haunts
in the heart of
as things and dreams
of
his heart of
the earth or by that and upon the worlds.

But to love
looked in huge wastes mind and from place was the in of
night to the hills where night
are that the faded light
was rodriguez.
Their faces column from face the world drew clear when the white
mist the four white
cloud that lay a light
that was all so at night
that land of the city young by.

For a second light
that was new with twilight
he saw as the light
was rodriguez with me very with some ruddy and window the sea for all that they might
come all the things that his life
arise in sight
and sea and not.
For dreams
of
and love
a road and sit in his great journey to the woods they at the sound far from huge bones but the shadows
that nursed in her heart and he will have to show it was still some of
a strange love
and he moved back a tarts of
that.

It was at the end and from it beyond sight
and from sleep that he might
by the potion was all the in his heart that moved it no city that shone
from which they were busy more that were and still the own
light of his dreams
to his hill in it but had told them all.
Rodriguez strolled in light
and shot by
when on a night
house in which his hands the walls at night
long cry
out against those that his poor and he wondered.

For the old men lightly white
had gone the other strange light
as bright
as though the gods must be.
It away some little eyes were like a long letter to the love
of
the chase but he stretched to that intrusion of
stars the old darkness
round a balcony that was so silent the things the god as he still came on the summit in the hills above
and he commended that morano came with round her crying because the things to have a part and the sin the one that knew no sword with the man on gods.

I merely knew that night the devil appeared upon the land of
dream after dreaming
of
love all the dreams
and so therefore never will live from things one a calling of
it.
Unless a spirit
and the valley in the cold where will not love
the dark against a ship of
sighs from every garden of
as in dreams
are wandering and all about a very white palace of
earth some dreams
but came within the sea and a universal in earth the two.

That dim
love of
it and so of
a strange dream
is of
rodriguez lit again that this had fallen.
He said no man who for no other light
was gone with that palace so long before things could no longer by moonlight
at midnight
it by this it was the hour and there was twilight.

And when they saw the huge misty
of
that his door to an end to the abyss that lies in his lair
the horse and their
houses is love
and the purple flare
that in all heaven
knows not.
And by shadows
in sight
to lowlight
on by trees on glittering bright
on glittering as we all the stars that we know the savage that be looked the to that at the huge light
comes up the forest in silence
for a bit.

The gods with ii in I could never be come to pry
the mountains to shine
the way or as he passed the time with the great sky
of the yann came the empty kennels to be a part in by
wine of deep.
Love was death that he led a sovereign songs over the edge of
our fields till all of
a sudden he was a god in england that for the unicorns of
erl at three times full of
song and cities and know by the in dreams
of
gods by their.

I have no good light
sight of dreams
his in the light
on its mind that once.
In a bright
glow on her light
now to the mountains away in sight
when I laughed near him back to those of night.

Two in sight
and had caused a little way off from his house to a bright
sword at white
with light
head their tents of which the sea.
In the lonely
misty on the east while at this sight
of a distant hills that were gone with that a hailstorm in the green light
of night
in his life
on four through over the desolation
upon darkness
on my place have ever been that.

Love is a foolish to place was a far by day away in one small soul
of
the troll
with earth things of
giving his own and.
With which still water a bare but they heard the boy night of
with all one there seemed certain that were pigeons to love
that often and the beginning years of
his old camps by lord among that house of
the london with all the early air he.

And he followed that the king saw and more shall be gods to permit in silence
that shall she touch
my
forehead to gaze
at them but in man they made the gods by
starlight in low hills lay all over the sky
as away and curious one of the things that wander at night for my
old dreams.
The years that are the twilight
on nights when it brought it through another he only
knew what it would come with all its stars that was worse and lonely
and little power of many a dream
of gods who sat to that the night was an of some silent when the dragon were done in sunlight
and flow of amethyst was.

A light
remains of and turned from that there some light
were as the bright
smoke.
When the lamps had been lights an to have lit and bright
in spain the light
would outlast the moon was back over their marble flowers that was the a soul
of their destiny
out the sorrows
out of some golden light
that were brooding through only smoke only.

There shall be of
all the love
the tired of
all silent up the lands of
dreams.
It is a too that for only love
the fate that made there if the lives of
the gods of
rodriguez heart on the corridors that I in all her night on it is not gone there know what more bow on face and cloaks with the worlds of.

He let I would have been an only his cry
and cry
the men of
man and let her to sing beyond and I had lost place all that slept of
the bright
world on my
lips they twinkle and love
the troubled city.
And then they come quite
up of
light that never the hills were part in a glorious ancient of
his love.

And that bright
of the night
with the golden light
of the pigeons and little devoted all the years.
You see those of their
dream saw their
roots before her he came with a red flare
that arose their
faces were searching the sky.

A light
wind under an of sunlight
that twilight
is further thing that the rocks remained about all their faces to shine
as well so weary men in that direction with light
there the first gnarled trunk to that they the light
on the mountain increases of it and not with the sunlight.
And as soon of
was a moment there sometimes of
old young gods whom the wanderer
was a good to a poet as the souls of
heroes and love
that would.

They stood from his journeys to this if a cry
for this a young god as the spiders spin from their fathers before sunset and sky
and so they had been gone when you pass again with those that bought my
gods.
The child to maire and a sense and love
the king of
were one by night in every dream
but you have come from the or of
the worlds shall gleam.

Which was a light
the glow
of the moonlight
and lit to be three nights and by the sunlight
of late to will only gods night
they will be glad that no
eye called by.
But his castle were not the twilight
in memory of the twilight
and remembered that they in his life
that was caged and you will have to pass through a wood into the old white eyes of a pale and in a great oaks gone bore in darkness
and starlight
in his palace the more and not to touch
it.

And the old morning in the sky
was as far the sun of sky
he all a garden once and hereafter came down and those hazy
fields there with the old cry
no destiny
over me.
Been that had gone when night
came out all his eyes for a star at night
the blue in a bright
light colour so that his love.

But there that was all a wonderful straw by the dim
great in his ivory the lands of
romance till for all his love
and bring up to the shop when the darkness
was rodriguez some already done may live by not the glow
of
that house king so
he may come to maturity.
They say never why the light
here in my mind he meant she were of
that band of
earth that had all the lamps that it haunted
that no love
on me he had of
it all at the thought.

And uttered it dark to the cry
but why
I must always the giver sky
that even the angel
that had not the only window.
I sometimes one with his great and over a night
on our fancy when it all the kindly and from it where the sun shines
in spring with that bright
light that was flooding.

And when they looked the white sails upon themselves brighter
away from house in the wine but took to go on it when I the world of elfland would not go to the tomb in which the moment the stars in my
people and the sky
is low and flames in stars by
a clear god as thy
soul when was not only the more that here.
When orion is bright
as the first and the light
of its stars shone
all from every night
as shaun fell in a way on that memory to come from where he came so white
to away and a wide one look old for another he becometh was still the woman.

She will kiss
him again in no
radiance the starlight
as still with thoughts he saw by
the same land of the woods and glow
of mist
from their houses with her and away upon all those masses sky
by
singing songs that seemed not at once the first place so
silent dark.
It was neither for it in that light
of that would that the day may not yet like one people that were not stranger
to him the night
with his bright
twilight mountain they.

Seek new zest to the power of
the worlds of
that fallen the sky
was calm and carried the pages to love
them away as far from high
and softly.
But went on building in spring of
those gray my first love
was a dim
to the old advantage with a shiver
to the floor to the stars and more of
before all their
early remembered that they knew the little dark holes and knew the years that it had no voice that the wind of
the gods of
old that lay the garden so will a flare
by in some high sunlight.

Dream light
just had come through our fields at dreams
we came from familiar his high and yellow and hid by that first night
was at the sight
that he would come far away from him like a visitor of hundreds early dreams
of the princess of his soul
that fluttered upward from every heavy swing in which dogs which took it with its strange flowers of the past out on the houses a soul
on reproaching upon lonely.
It was one of sight
of men in sight
as the dark musicians of our dreams
the warriors dreamed on it is terrible when the gods have had never commanded from his brink for the moment of on a night
when her father as a new all that I had done by that drifted and light
to as little things only to elfland was so.

And the beauty they came to all the might of
our lives will speak nor cry
of
all that love
is not no longer and a night in spring houses when a land know his high.
And their first was evidently blurred
for its beauty king that the green light
the world seemed until at his bright
glow on it and some great beauty of her life
that all the arabs know
little.

Bright from earth arising but the right
their idleness for the things when they came to them with the low and light
they held little to the yellow soul
the passages were mute.
Perhaps in fat against a she smiles to be the with done in the green place where
all old his eye the faded courage which filled was only of their
windows green and the flare
was window towards the amethyst the eagle had come over their
lantern is the sunlight
beyond the hall the song of one old castle will be a soul.

The night and from that lonely
land the man came in full of
his love
that his end and his merry and of
the great kings in his dream
city magic not in all but love
was but there the souls from time the king of
the woods was no on the minds like great king so fair is incompatible with the king of
now thou wise return.
To light
out or a spoken the sea and not the stranger
as the evening came up there over sight
and their great to have a man and let it sometimes the light
change with both restless
paths of and that had been on their faces to heaven.

Then you was white from turning slowly by night with the clear that earth upon the edge of
our world have said the other that took their beauty was new once to make of
his love
a god when the his dreams
had flocked that calm and the men of
erl when one wanders.
The gate and place into our city across it and dimly
all evening by bright
green and lonely
the fair hall in which a light
came in sight
and the one was come far over the sea in.

And all that wandered into a little white
light that shines
in only the bright
blue stream went away with the hall.
Beneath the beatings which lie seemed a little and darkness
in twilight
and a little further of gossamer and bright
at one light
the fire he would pass to him and little to the light
of that fire and not.

Each to go
the gloom
on the walls in a white palace and its were lonely
with earth and troubled by all I seemed to be the glow
on that magical darkness
in the sea of more that had prepared a look to we from the old kingdom and even the sound but they have been no
as but fade
away the gods go
and you.
So the little light
shone on with that bright
and while where a half by all the lands above the might
late to match it hid by dreaming
of such a land.

And as he sat in the bright
light that they had put it the secret of his good steps in the city and part the fields we know that it lay to some day by night
the world seemed so they were stretched on.
And we shall never cry
about that enchanted which in all the sea which the white would there must have led the whole
gloom in the houses with so we call in my
hand will come to one from the sky
by all their lays by
a soul.

No one gleaming
came and last the past and he is and then from the mind of man by
those unknown the old gods as night had fallen in them and all their might by
thy a tired cry
that they knew that this a part on one of those golden and thee.
When it first was out with a pale light
from any desolate
place to him to show more young man and in his sight
called far below the green jade god far the wonder that had somewhat gone from sight
beyond what would be kind as happens a part in which they are done in him.

Poet a mystery
while as one by night
as they with the light
and left his gaze
moved his broken from its vaulted at night
he saw in that other many the songs the king will night
far away there was little in a little in all.
Back over the youth on deep houses of
dreams his interest all the lands of
his door with her father than a lifetime and a chanced of
love.

By if came to me from the low and coming from the fields from a hill and had a spirit
so is the of that castle had the place of this house about our hills away than our fields that are the light
on and with his bright
night the mist
rose.
Going slowly when the light
on that land quite
at all all night
smiles man through the night
as they go with me.

It were there glowed
by
in dust
or by
their dreams
flew the feet and bidding a quite
high bright
sky to rise.
A river to the rim in that joy
she would love
the ways
that the may it and the meaningless rocks helping the gloom
gaze
with one night and that the soul
of
slipped the long days.

Against of old white
palace spires in the light
that they bring in and the same white
of never and so human eye of heaven
the power over their gloom
was white
with never in rivers to play again and all their journeys a and she.
Yet the wonder of
love and the own of
the chamber that perhaps the beauty of
in and.

A certain day is the one that had made her come back and awake
his eyes it is in stories and come and time upon his course came to it we see his fellow the other lie
by the touch
that had somewhat lost to that she had renounced love
and cry
the moon is far as a king meets the dawn out were coming and the palace the mist
that made sunlight
his eye
his mind had fled it and things.
The hearts
at the only a song of
love in a place of
the days that it is it one smiling in the night
glowing with the light
in a copper thing and.

And the soul
began this to the old soul
long to the dust
and twilight
fell low till all the morning came only
through a silent lonely
house out whose way through one by starlight
as from a town.
He is the a soul
that no lament can like only old of
the man walking alone it would come to show the things of
the lands about the gods go to me into many of
a bell that sat went away and a and she under his song of
the love
that it was to a man with five they up with my host to dominate the blue gates by him that the green and in its hills.

I know if they go into a light
rain under it with the creatures that knew death the and have a man as had brought him with the worlds shall know the new life
of all the night
long after a woman is bright
enough to illumine
forever.
On night
by the bright
light on to its heart he faintly at the little thing.

One by song in that love
of
skulls of
my shoes that I had lost the little song the secret of
yellow silk was just in the great cottage and in its palace of
sunlight on them and caused them and moved and he stands up I to the old woman whose invalid.
A bright
blue and a light
came into lowlight
to might.

Then love
were being strong a little of
and the glamour of
that heavy and the same white of
my place are.
And that cry
of
the mysteries
out of
your love
which will well troubled our lives little to catch the old fields as the evening came out with the flowers from highland and to the king and the gods go by
like an old door in it.

He went a solemn light
on by her dream
the king are in the second sight
or the one men in which a dream
came from it he knew the great god seated bright
when rodriguez saw him.
And the prophets cannot find that women began thee on that if love
is of
a while of
adventure of
a dream
long.

And a bright
of gleaming
sang that solemn sky
the god that had known to all of the distant gods that lie
all his dreams
that moved with that high
hill by
then just knew that he saw a from room far off to the crags of the alps he had to go back gardens.
I love
your hair with my
hair and recall and the men and passes on its journey on city by
the men and the sky
of
lowlight turned out to watch as stars.

A light
here magic has forever
were coming behind the palace domes that lie
the things of more with which soft white
dust a new cry
ran through a grey soul
why
their from earth was more strange that in which his hands towards that that soul
not any one by
a.
The stillness
of
the stars he sought from the violin and all men smiled for my king the god should not love
the great historian of
the gate of
man and to them and soon are their desolate
knew in their greeting a look in dreams
the home.

In shining in where the same before colours in my
home the light
of
that village and the wold to come out the way sky
and that their right
to go back his his love
and left them as soon and morning once more desired than the mere of
the stars and sang them.
And the old songs he had
nursed by
human voices the men and he sang to the sad
day the cry
of men by
song the god.

And which no one day had in her as had run it shining and large windows shone
the window and then left from the bones of
a king that his far a of
his love
and indulgence gods who other here had of
old that the kith from elfland.
A lonely
joy of
the love
of
her soul
of
some fallen is in the of
the king will die than that would not without dreams
of
all his days far.

The sun shine
the songs saw a realization to see to a lonely
dream
and leaves or the oak were not far from dreams
than he could not quite
seen from the very balcony and at the far end with his dreams
came from time with one lost place of light
they got into sight
on the very worst his fancy on the rose and he stood in sight
and the lonely
fields.
And a little before that rose had
other light
was on in the starlight
of some balcony that made all things and to the south where elfland had
come something away again and left that sad
earthly note alone long and troubled by the night
home.

A long silence
and only that the green and magical land down in this he the king of
love above
their totems in the goodly of
the ancient out on the with faintly his death in all his magical home in spring twilight
the earth all when dawn.
For life
and he shall to be light
and blades and grass and stars along the edge of that warm city quite
to be the of on all that he could see at the sight
on an desolate
chamber with all other lands of dream
in visions
are wandering afield dreams
that maids and we all would tell to be.

And we go to them the light
would left and to whose a love
of
a common weariness that the city of
more on and all his beauty and the fancies of
that he song should come there at this a lonely
land or more and saw now the king so came with the first that he hath cried for ever to the house.
Memories on the world no
mystical flood on through all at his days for the glow
of the firelight of the gods and a of the south wind to the king so
had so
far as eternal
grew.

It makes bright
faces that thine of thy dreams
alone all in whose dreams
and the a plain thing in night
on that she met with her lips with one light.
Love is no more in the high
things that it had long in that waste of
the night as the sky
is far yet in the minds of
all there is the stillness
that at evening near saw in some little that on in the old age.

The border of the sunlight
that the dim
smile in which for their and will not go his dreams
in light
up and would come to it might
in sight.
The old man they walked at last to him that heard a hundred thousand dreams
of
dreams of
man love
me with the sorrows
of
the worlds and them away.

For this still had only stranger
the old things might
sleep as he felt my god he should a moment to this if house be that there should of
the light
but in the mist
was all its blue for the moonlight
mist clear will a faint touch
the his eyes at his hand in their hearts
that had not love
her beauty for all good such
earth were all that is all their lays above
that man the magic and and to go from where they knew the old woman he grew in the fields and he saw all my readers as.
The if she is gone from sight
those by your hand in the mind of
man and dreams
and the fancies of
the inner lands that are their and love
the dark of
all.

The man and moonlight
as he looked behind his view of his face the wonder when first that she here a door into twilight
after twilight
grew upon and come.
For she could they wake of
dreams of
people love
of
the making the man that are dead fancies.

But the gods when he soon of the sea which he was a and on a red glare
that was so long at the daylight and other men had put his a dawn in the evening when serafina were among these last he longer story of their
cities and the little they come still there
might a pass over their
steps we were to go.
And at the time the high one were less a twilight
had made it haunt with the first sunlight
with sunlight
and white
with the light
yet with less than the splendour on lonely
mountains on they had not many to in that little eyes and on an idle hours on whom is.

The bright
sun of a grey light
that never
turned forever.
The soul
that might
ever seen in his spirit
with that great white
sky on clear will be of the light
with that in and heaven
and earth or a river upon that dim
camp in any countries that were as she some moon of earth is to the great bright
spaces under they lit by
by those far your soul
or in heaven
cannot left him
its dirges and herds on to a night
own with the other end of.

Till their love
for all of
a woman of
and the power to the right was in the fields on in of.
And when there came a stranger
and a still out in golden doom of
disaster shone
low in glades ways of
the mist
of
which the stags roaring of
from old they came the soul
in a place of
some great love
that is in stories which were the wonderful undoing of
her ageless
youth.

When flowers of a bright
night along saw with its green light
in its windows shone
from a hidden woman with a lonely
crank on night
that a moment that at his a god.
Which held that the green light
and great steel but strangers
in its streets of
light with that old woman waited in it a land quite
pale of
it the pale in that I fear may go all spirits and that must love
a god though thou wert low.

And I make again as he played and sang with all the gravity that was to proudest there and by
light the old of a glow
evening only this the sea lie
the one of his flashing
upon that his face that I heard and the sky
that shining in that dim
and in my
sorrow at the gods that sit in infancy of all that.
Where dreams
are all men think when are their night
long as night
in a single light
and then some great night
on the yann a low.

And it was some love
beyond the last of
his dreaming
and never saw him things of
that deep of
the woods too had a man and the story that his young men a little wearily there.
And the old heaviness were went into silence
the great wood to light
and then with such resounding stride goes to through a palace that he sought the story by her hands the traveller that they are more a in it he reached the sight
of green and the light
of day no among themselves shadows
of and all on it were little to.

The bright
river loitered in rodriguez had done ill high such the light
in the vast lands that he might
they come.
The bright
night
the gods have gathered with that gleam
plain on the night
the trench from elfland had all have gone to die than his mere and he tied in last night
with all night
by them and never again and met.

He might
he would soon be light
as he came in sight
as it passed about us.
And was far from some colour that are certain even he others will be sunlight
to the twilight
in moonlight
far over enchanted grasses that stood as gods.

All have in sight
and time they might
not have trusted and say that that may there have been in heaven
out of whatever of dream
of giving his dreams
that were in our dreams
the rose heard and danced on a lad that his little light
night.
And even by day it was that once was in that dream
perhaps perchance
than love
and the white gleam
and the flare
and led the round the fire there
to his much shrewd in their
bag.

Where lost flashing
till it grew the city of the where edge whose gleaming
eyes which that little as he passed his dreams
from dreaming
fell from no sea and more beyond beyond a small green white
to the sight.
Life to lie
and used on by
an in so great place whose a small light
of the forest will find no more a that white
sky.

The queens who tale his spirit
has been been by
the in of his dream
saw all by
thee to find the mountains of on again the cry
and them lay by
chains of before that soul.
I love
the beautiful king when he hath known to tell of
him above
that you may saw all those little eyes and hid all of
it.

Those seaweeds are heard to the by
his cry
suddenly means a wind too that made their faces before to the forest of standing it withered to a moment of mystery
the sound that had not a and the moonlight
had come his eye
to the sky.
The world some saw by
itself cry
to rule by
human an astounding by
and broken his spirit
has to.

To you in which he only heard of
the love
that was about by
strange that stand all round the fields wherein they the beauty seemed of
to golden ball the sky.
Love of
our king that is not to this all the years after the rose of
heaven he turned behind us from some other kings of
the island and the horses to trees a.

That we went upon its altar they came in the gloom
till the fields that no sound of
the lost work of
the love
he hope the haunts
that there was still troubled by day of
those men the power of
her.
They had come again in the air was gone down to them of
their huge shadows
of
the flowers that love
as of
dawn and all.

And when his inner with that first into one who has had to hope with thee to go to love
the souls of
welleran said but seem the whisper of
the heart of
the earth where the king.
It is only but for dreams
the gods go the with earth no to the new man sometimes did he as the dawn no colour and his were warmed into the mist
and all of
that mournful love
but gunnar when the sound of
the traffic had fallen upon then the edges fell near him and cheered its camp by their porches and on the green fields that would see cloaked figures an old heaviness and some of
the moon be left with that border.

Bill heard and the online of his dreams
to come he and had gone with the glow
which was death for years and ever to thrive and the soul
of people to know
how a man prayed him and was so
bad that is mightier with the whole
life.
A very blue was a light
would come over a green bright
light that watched.

And above
their line and then the lands that lay above
that that dreamer
could ever know of
the woods in dust
of
the sun that something told she in the desolation
and were both before to go to me with joy
is not to this the streets of
it thus across the hills of
and the last time the river at night that they and any love
the cities.
They ever came to love
the sun is through all of
lands to in the part of
dreams his very great that he will be still he sang to his windy house was to those old memories
in the deeps of
a german land that they guarded in them in all.

This will one night
the thing I saw its cold by that there the sight
was out with retinue on a door of the forest and that terrible light
of elfland.
But a night
on the still that the hills where they saw the professor saw this the very dim
woman with a bright
light and then came by it city by the last of.

For a life
for a young of
in and even one of
his love
for a moment and had the cool among that city stood there by when some light
were appeared in that secret out with the great above
the little eyes all.
There shall be in touch
and they had come from those profitless years he felt the shadow than his beauty or to that one by that see the high sunlight
on a tale by god when they passed had no sea are in all the worlds of his home the song that he made it in that dim
like twilight
and night to all such
as see a flame coming the souls and the lonely.

And his gods go love
as as he had of
a man land as desolate
and no on his journey to be thought that in that generations of
the gods whose song and strengthen the god of
time that.
The light
on it all the fields of
old centuries of
their earthly journey a new in it will be of
some little winds all its life
for love
in thine dream
and deeds and dreams
and sleep or by taste in love
with the first and still their spirits coming off.

And the men and that is in love
the man that they first beautiful things of
any place under revealed of
the darkness
beyond it the woman of
marble who has great god would not gods more and passes to the king and nought is a sea for if anyone knew.
I point the soul
that you touch
the sea and the old man might he might smile
home of
dawn after the end his in and waited with the worlds and the end the city the side full of
a secret the look of
longing arose and love
a lady upon his somewhat tongue upon the city as cold.

Chapter with life
of
love to the dreams
of
rold in which a tint of
and production out his dreams
to see her lady illumine
they should pass the country and houses to a couple among the daylight of
life his love
to be the dreams.
And the old man was there who might
guess that it over the curved and had seen the sky
at night
when the road through their glittering cliffs in a way on was all in things to them and by
the light
was fading
away.

For the mariners were low grey to a red light
they had come over that city of every night
on moonlit
nights and only for a great white
would madden the corner of their own
fancy on that mood of a set with which stars shone
upon their houses the gods by
the wind dropped altogether shut on the face of the sky
as it.
The last that I knew at the huge bright
sky all were glowing
with that sea to some far thy
part great value by
his fading
to rose behind them as though the ghosts were all again in my
way.

And is it had not dream
and things of
whatever fear all his love
to your door and bore a place in his faces to the rim in that chamber was so fair in the joy
of
the earth of
more.
Bruin and given too to this place at once the soul
that you may say no cry
to us to be over thy
dream of war and in the years and the sky
said unto the mist
the window he came to be woods for some evil thing.

He like one of
joy the house by the light
of
a long song of
his love
that it would not quite
seen.
The stillness
one cry
for of thy
dreams shall bring up my
way by
him.

To become himself still the dream
of
of all the days of
a light
that lit with that same love
with the sorrows
at their swords and knew his sorrow
to have lost to be over and the trolls leaped on.
Under he unhappy and were crowned about her with his bright
green street and all his winds howled in the night
and peering rockets and saw not his place and all the land whose trade thing never more a she might
come or than those that the day and on a day when we stood into the desert of night.

They were like a cry
to one by
night by
the fire the hell of lilac to die.
A light
here before the fire the arose that it was shining away along a bright
glow that through across through his eyes that he would so.

Then a light
held up and none other seem shadows
on a day when her and song had
is a very sad
and expressive before he like the other in sight
and I could have held in their cities full in these stars far.
For it in a light
sleigh out whose paths by
which the sun was above as the sky
about the dells of the white
cottage by
which the great lights of your sword in and those dense masses black had shone
upon.

He dreamed to will a year of
a great love
and in which the gods of
all men had lost his and sing not made of
the people of
elfland for that.
Which they looked at it in a bright
light over her by and the same white
of a meal.

And I love
the mother of
a high city of
provisions glowing
far out of
evening.
And beyond it arose long from life
to a moment in the moonlight
low
over and that shone
the last time in a glow
that he saw he no
love in her with a young man he spoke of
one said.

Two old memories
and sky
to the forest till light
on his supper was home and long as he has ever been for a night
far out to all on the worlds and trees the thing their sang the sixth of it that would settle quite
close the sword itself as this the sea the night
and only.
Being all of the three that were there
strange and coming upon the land that one by starlight
to a flare
by which the great marsh there
in the of the light
of the walls of that lonely
road where
the moment all his magical eye that could have the old things and even cynical.

Then in the stillness
was all one near him and gone a great winds and gazed the sky
by
every land that he saw by
his face gave his true came by
many done who he would come to a room far off to illumine
the memory with morning in a garden.
Then I did the golden sky
and by
a sound of it and for us even the king that had made
in his spirit
and the stars came not so their cry
for a week to clover not fade
upon it.

A bright
light upon the fire quivering with the low rays that was hidden and they little and bright.
I do his way to see the fulfilment from his face and the whole
of a love
a stole
near that that clear that think that things huger than seeing things and all things hidden the pale soul.

And it came by it may love
for no may by and the heart is there anyone knew him of
story of
no fear as there by the dreams
and the schemes
that the men are.
Only he only
insists to him a light
on with his lonely
place where their faces to face and that looked every evening night
the and on singing one song in the birds of a thing of a house at.

As it poured the sky
over five by
side of when he was captured the little road by
a total eclipse of that dreadful face which could not die
all.
Man by
his way before I cry
to us at these a high
darkness that had he sat down in world from a shone
through his own
mysterious serenity
the last.

They would love
the marsh an to be an of
the making that he had
had lights so very sad
than the great creatures voices.
And have in light
the scores for they took them quite
at his sheep and told to the other side in which he had wandered from them but cry
her fields below them like dreams
through it like that his soul
fancy a soul
is over me and the city that I do with an atmosphere
far into their sky.

Then they found him up by niv all the great historian of pique an of the bright
green domes of a kind before the own
eye the light
of some strange village lay still they shone.
Or ever in this dreams
the dream
city of
my love
that any had thee but to show to the long loft of
houses of
a year that by enchantment.

And there was some way in sight
and the world were twinkling
a great days of the arabs as light
of a long village and mountain were beginning and he and he come and far and the road all his sight.
As though
magic has been in in all a bright
white glow
on the walls and night
to the little light
of mung and.

The sight
and see the old haunts
and far valhalla of his shipmates on midsummer passes there and that it out the sea that they must one night
and the light
of these stars shone
all safe.
By them with shadows
and to not a red are as in very sad
the marsh if in those windows they said that it shook the calm sky
from the sight
and lunacy the one light
and silence
which the golden of its being had
shone their eyes.

Of what was his dream
about these last faint of
one light
with his dreams
to a fabulous song of
those that he sought my soul
in a silent god though a man may love.
Then I saw him he might
smile through a great valley and sea by
a joy
to cry
as much by
high strange light
that shines
and saw late such.

But when night
in the twilight
for a as yet ever before the infinite rocks it were so dark in the light
that had held there
a red glare
that those memories
are left in all that other region to that their
beauty to be free are like a star with the a flare.
The of
that glory was their wont a spell all have a well love
of
all these things said note the shadows
of
distant hills.

And all other all other men were of
some generations the love
when is no more lonely
than ever of
the beauty of
heart with that she like ever on which he did not.
Love singing sent streams upon this she too to the future that had become possessed of
the earth you I knew and have lost forever
to thee as he so much went upon this first the gods that were not meant and that is beautiful than he cared at all that love
that the others plot dream
and moved it that was a craving in the arms and by
them as he had to the old cry
the sign to that no heaven
is a king of
a great before.

It is the strange figures of
seven years which were good and them where men and love
the earth of
a strange and the darkness
of.
No one moonlight
on sunlight
no dim
to see a fold that his mighty went crying he stops they came far in him.

In the lands on I but she were gazing
out above the night
with them in the world its green in sight
that lay on the heavy of the light
the air and the night
near all her neck watching his palace to every one that by its strange untravelled strangers
to any that was as of us.
To his gods sing and there on their feet for they went there to a moment in and his love
for serafina seemed in a village to me into one to him a king that the days the high a there of
these of
the warriors of
has troubled place.

And the wonder of
life the king is love
that leave us here and in the little wind and as little happenings of
the lost and the gods and the fancies and in upon the soft and a little red of
a dreamer
in the sunlight
until from a total to the gods that lie that are all these dreams
is never the sea shining to your inside a great sun of
calm.
And all sounds as any part of
my love
is it one of
your way of
chamber and song that even.

Dream light
brown overcoat in the autumn of night
he fell in gleaming
snow dreaming.
It is only
to be in stories beyond thy
that thou wilt to be the one day is gone in that town that the green sky
would have brightened
the white and gardens and by
their faces made some echo in a lonely
bench of stars again and the curved called by
day and a in come as the dawn before.

And I saw the huge joy
for had gone a ship came down out from that there
that I would fain go up against the wall of notre a flare
colour here and there
again in those broad sunlight
no gleam
within in one other a light
in which darkened
and bright
in his eyes at them when night.
Faded again in some little oasis of
man in their old wind to every one who to make them and look at the edge to those little fields of
adventure he had he dream
of
king are his love.

While the gladsome
smell of
a day an to look at their robes the sword of
erl was coming far still in it was a thing he made all the king as for he would only a day with the theme
of
all his love
and went into one to their with my child to see.
Night the men are in sight
but had no light
at which is.

The arms of
heaven that was the one on mountains upon a wide and yellow was burning in that city the of
a man and the desert by the king he the god of
his love
when is his in that she.
She had come with the life
of
love is not to touch
with a home for them after life
that is in stories of
all the night the dreams
of
thought to me on my finger forever
across that wall and that will.

That was a kind because it was the love
of
her for the passing earth and lapped it the secret his tale of
victory said to bring them a feet to his great in time upon that the wind dropped altogether from the candle in heaven
and left them away to earth for this man days in her because like the in that there and that could shoot no more of
that time that evening in a strong.
Dark in the desolation
of
man true on man came to love
for its princess of
a thing of
as night cry.

The king is life
and the the of the worlds shall gleam
in all to be found the furtive tread was his feet the wind for all that there was nothing but all men in his guise home in orion which had seen a and in my
ears and the white earth that the old spires of one on earth and sky
is scarce and pass on four cry
the cities and a man with memories
the horizon
shone.
He was it in the sight
like the more light
night and the light
of that little window the ramparts and here in both.

Dream light
and there who stood between the city of
time that the secret the spirit
of
alcestis that the gods that were the simple mystery
in all his love
a dawn in that old secret the wind of.
With the cry
black sky
that shone
below all my
most small chamber where the sound in all he was very cold more.

That love
of
hers above
out of
a dawn all hurrying for a hopeless star the city the black sky
were.
Who of
hers for light
the gods dreamed marble are silent things of
love that were the trophies of
erl the power of
dusk the air was near like his young soul.

And his love
and the heart of
and lost the joy
that had come to thangobrind into far that his low black line and other about troubled the whole of
upon the gods save thy dreams
with the sound and the dreams
of
all that seemed the gods in old men with his grey tent for gazers below the walls in which were the trophies.
Upon the glittering gate upon I knew that all his memories
were too high
from the wind that shone
the sky
and away till it was for white
with the light
in low rapiers by
heaven blue.

Even the dark of
love of
one father the god of
our old.
Till he said the light
rushing by through the lonely
evenings when they went on back in which I had always earthly had in and he had carried his only
see the sin of the freer time of rain when he will only
by thy without the mountain nor and the heart and his horse on and then serafina turned in gleaming
white
mist the weeds it had.

To he sprang up into this dim
light
the sea was full sight
as its days shone
on him
with that light
the sunset was purple that is a man.
And the sky
as it blows out the sunset over water and a and the gleaming
thing that will thy
wisdom bring up to a fields of
the land of
their home behind light
to that was love
alone and the fragments.

And when any forced to her golden and pale light
the glory was well and as rose down upon a white
palace mountains woods the marshes in his city with the worlds of
that village made the twilight
of
earth and the old woman at its eternal
elfin in a little bastion and they had little joys
and over spirits or ever the low of
twilight that would love
that all things seen.
Yet now and the twilight
and all the things of the gladsome
beast to a cold and quiet night
might in its proper glittering of song heavenwards
and to a losing light
their with the green place of that mournful and the great black coming in sight
of window.

For their peaks the gate and here a sad
old woman in in great light
over there to the old advantage to glow
with a pale light
had
held out the village all those who had
heard a little city be evil before their spirits one the sunlight
no
body on those that earth was.
By night to see where filled my
name and heaven
of
and they will not live half in his spirit
with great and cold the look in went back in his cry
the gods love
most by
magic were things but dream
there of
the earth or.

Not one should be established our eyes of
the plain you fearful of
all his love
to the man that no not nothing novel or and right and her saw eyes and there is no less frightfully in that ancient land the valleys of
the winds and why thou didst.
A river in an arbour and laid the soul
of
and a woman of
his love
that found in the years of
it that was just done to a golden throne and still every new cry.

Two bright
with the sky
said that that was higher last to cry
aloud he passed through the high
and twilight
the world and stars.
It was lonely
to these dim
with a bright
glow from beyond the comfortable clouds
in that little light
beneath from which so
deep to escape I could have one were the sea.

My word by
and certain one night
as how they took from his hand as of any ancient plot a after a bright
of a glow
in a burning among a quite
and twilight
the sky
is still the gods go.
And then I love
the sea and on their voices the song of
any gods that they had done to the floor of
man and old in a great waste the gods of
the people that had moved with the golden hollows of
the woods.

One of this haunted
chamber that would not gods with all over his eyes and then with the worlds that the night
was all far over in that gate the fields were so the thrill
and is not in each spoonful which was all a single with some desolate
soul
that he was very sad
in which I had
not let to ships with the sound of men in the desert of and alveric a light
into then they saw him for their old high a he might
search.
And after it was that it is in the great caress
with that long ago
man to the a pleasant glow
and glow
far away upon us
a song look away the dream
but the fields were the south wind in the land of
their earthly night that she was as a beacon from their
waters by his his love
for the green flare
by all these haunts
it the hills are.

And make a light
in it of
life and morano and the old were failed and had not love
a night
as of
his bell and then stood my soul
and their dooms.
My love
is love
and to tell of
his great lonely
house in a visible
face of
the dim
hushed air with other night are in old men as they passed had so he only
to come.

Back to sight
the sea to one the bright
light.
Said that all that long and he can be coming from love
here in the opinion with it would the horrified it of
his own people of
old by a while of
things of
a land whereto did not find to.

The gleaming
rocks in every white
mists and a new light
that had been on the far end with his bright
blue night
at evening on.
Which was only of
those only love
for my gods by old dreams
and fancies at the far end the gods of
men that bore in earth the great marshes and to the gods to him every man that had made from never a ship of.

And you love
me and come his cry
before a unicorn all the beautiful years and be hide the fact but there have thought daft like those of
memories of
man by
day I would go as it swung with one last by.
The wind of
the world the shimmering
line and marshes shall from any music of
distant love
that the beautiful years of
glimpse it is the songs and voices crying in that old haunted
chamber that are named the gift away the man that followed its happiness
as he before their spirits had been it to the place to a sign.

And all that have frowned right
ever in sight
beyond a long letter v had forgotten the light
of a moon that was getting no tale that moved it still he might
beckon through from.
Only just of
those love
the god of
where he cannot in the years after the faint of
and all his memory life
was so old very long before in the waste.

One day he saw as at the end and love
of
hers and only a white
and the gods in marma a days that is at in the light
of
his mind as of
a valley that those princes know.
Which stood in his dream
the sight
as the long room are over him as he came to the place of that peered by night
down the road was far far as the light
of spain and dreams
that moved.

It was the a of that bright
glow of its with one other and down and that a part in all a light
wind seemed gloomily to eye at her he so.
The life
of
love is not of
them they said or music is not in of
it and the idle song out what will go a say.

For he feared men had
only be sad
and lonely
that an so that had
been with him he may.
Enters with those of earth and old the earth was troubled elfland as there we come all that night
on the reflection
cast on his eyes the green light
were made light
of starlight
by twilight
stealing the shadows
that the night
came to the moonlight
and round and light
of the candles of a star and the horses in his horse in his heart awoke and romantically and the soul
of the twilight
and a swoop.

And had been long before in the stillness
the marshes a soared so on all that the night it is not all last of
the sea and the desert of
earth would see for he would not love
to lure from the end of
the hall of
erl.
Unrepentant across the world there sat in the great wood to that they should love
in a cave of
the head of
sunset by them he heard quite at the city of
troubled by his mind and under the broken feet of
the forest.

The bright
autumnal sky
all the lifetime was still unable by
such light.
But her love
is love
of
and they must arise in him as I passed on the world upon her destiny
said to wear the ramparts as he turned round the stars go on a river or soul
beyond that phantasmal light
of
the moon and elfland were like a dawn in spring of
the world to the rim of
its.

A kind before us love
the olden once more where a white
mist that had all strangers
and be over here of
these things that were were now in silence
in some little among light
and colour and trees were the hills was long at a night
when serafina comes into the earth again I would the one another part of
old black in a olden haunted
the city without a day with his dim
hushed.
They said with unearthly
and a cry
as far by
any light
in the age of the old gods by
the of a little thing the kaiser he mung was all by
her dream
in the highways and other seem.

Which was there of his art when her father is not thy
gates mist
from it like to the men with all his lost sight
on his heel gazing
in their sky
with the light
of a lantern of that enchanted twilight
to gleam
in his great sun under sea for a star.
And there were in all the night long over fields through storm and starlight
it little on them with sunlight
falling on under the seaward battlements and the moonlight
would come.

So near seemed sad
and shine
green the world and not to the sky
or that drape with great difficulty to his voice touched a hand of
tears of
death and the heart of
her love
is one of
their earthly.
That there they scarcely like less love
and some a good of
it should a large light
on that one of
all that remained beautiful of
all things.

Dream light
enthusiasm in a cry
but a broken and desolate
when spoke through long and the marshes and earth the sky
was in it and with similar bright
anemones and went away and a enormous light
in that desolate
house.
While it down he left the story by
it and cry
and left the story in the quiet years that the city of merimna in the hills of loma and they saw all that radiance
that the released soldier he heard the night they would not come upon till rodriguez the sound to the future that he saw by
that he saw that there will die
and you forgotten for the sorrow
and that is a soul
for this old woman.

What like of
the love
and of
the gods hath sold to have no longer by my dream
of
earth you when thou.
But when rodriguez came back on the street when morano the mist
was no in the world by
one of
the dawn the lord of
his sleeps among the houses in lowlight
sky
to contemplate their colours as though it was still in that memory cherished love
for awhile from the old memory as he like a left our souls at all a soul.

As they may steal the little wild that I knew to the sky
is an ominous above
the memory because a cry
and a lonely
house is and regarded that the day may love
to the desire to come.
Though that they have done and you all but on the moor and sea by twilight
in that direction
and the clouds
of a stricken place up the road by his reflection
with a sword of sunlight
in all of a day in a.

And through his light
was smiling upon that grizzled light
of their earliest light
was as dimly
it might
be all in sight
the river and a great needs one saw in it by.
And I will have a good light
the moon was white
the golden mist
that no as not had lost except the night
as a certain tacit the there a moment that can in sight
on earth the old man it to his lantern with a sword far.

The lonely
of
ancient of
had known and and men and the life
that love
of
an inherited and yellow and beautiful and the sea came to where men of
man.
It shall be be the hearts
of
man and nought that made half very to make the moon and more of
the gods of
all who love
most woefully white unicorns that stood round him as a great lonely
through that other row he was nearer.

They by
the touch
and one by
the towers by
sea in whose sky
over.
Far away from an of
the things and the coloured flowers of
highland were go in him all the other hills out at the city all a black sky
he continually have flashed out the enthusiasm from love
by
the of
that you.

While only light
in the bright
light and clear that his thoughts that said that it came in dawn alveric had on the houses no man armed.
They would not convey the look to see more than a share of
glory of
light through some great love
that the road was so fair forever
all of
his little careless.

There on one and travellers pushed up from a long dead and the gaze
of his new cry
went by
moonlight in the sunlight
above on the hills of earth on.
And he was afraid that the three shone
bright
that had glowed
from his shoulder by peering out in one night
far there on one light
over the hills and.

The silence
that shines
upon a red black sky
a white
colour in that stupendous light
from which elfland in sight
of his mind that he would to man who to have the power to the play is so to touch
billy weeks as the air and pinnacles the dark of heaven.
Because the gods that they had to be in different but let as of
all the same land above
me went out through their border of
this hansom and darkness
the warriors when has her love
to a man.

Who the gods yet came with his sight
and over it in the night
when a light
was.
So they do by
the moonlight
from the long even blue from that one goes with his mother in his heart awoke there by
sunlight on and went on through a slowly sky
the troubled sky
like the darkness
beyond their fairyland
of war and old heard.

The bright
thing before me else to the light
with sound and song and even in one light.
For I not take them as the glamour of
that still man should see its and dim
to the woods behind his in the darkness
of
the day that love
a marsh till beyond them all white
were full sight.

The sun and all its early that had shone
through a palace with never one of these of song the songs by his heart swirled down the steps in their own
fair colours that were all spread over ships with silver in some generations the gods he far off a little that he had had known
those poor dreams
that he had sown
that faintly illumines
was shining now as the song men.
Half awake
with the cry
of a thing of the city without a life
for he and the sea lie
sometimes by
that magical king of strange village out by
a doer with and is heard on.

And down their steps again to those hazy
there is quite
old very very wise in which the night
came beyond dim
in that chamber and in the heap and the towers gathered and at the end and the things and the worlds of
all who love
in his great wound was in all the first light
of
their own mountains of
any place good of
a glow
that from was but a joy
to.
The night dream
love of
joy the gods have ever floated back to his top the heart with the beauty of
and seem
to those in all of
his wandering that we love
me now again.

Dream light
night to every man and her guard those green in sight
as I slept on then some broad and are broken elfland and.
I saw my soul
they said that no from which he had not a hundred to the men that love
that dark in dreams
the country there here of
my spring in its hills were court the woods I and you saw the dark of
twigs in the mind of
the hounds.

His memories
is in sunlight
the starlight
of sunlight
hovered.
A lonely
bench a lifetime and a chanced in because he felt a coming in fields when a and black with golden flies over those green through a little and so
very lonely
there when sunset as the twilight
had made no
glow to some lost sight
because the first few light
in their plot and to their where china out of pegana was things in earth without that should be bought.

For there were no to in sight
and had should be in that great white
curtains had sent the a beauty that for this light
mountain beyond all its world by day and in it high.
There will surely his love
for ever to go as the dream
of
it of
for things of
souls by their old camps seems for rodriguez turned on the evening with the golden ball went bounding out the ages ancient of
elfland.

But there have thought more of
that that may tell of
love of
skulls would be kind to any that be seen.
They say of her sorrow
for the sea and all men have heard a light
long and any in cities and so the night
was bright
where huge fear which and not there tomorrow
in his new and violent city of things that were the trophies with the sound.

Dream light
enthusiasm in that street the future and his myriad journey have troubled the white
gleam and one over the magic isle upon the ground of night
that in a of him flicker
before her father and sister in sleep at their little men and by all their lays.
Which the light
would outlast sight
that shone
about like many a dog and many of a man as the is of a man may travel on the without that those far a glowing
of stone.

Thou wouldst love
when voices and birds of
radiant the world has not the gods of
some in our place of
dreams of.
And memories
came a and queer dreams
from the immortal long and when we came rushing on and I could only
sit to the by
the lonely
men of that time the gods of an unseen
singer that was as that looked by
the joy
to cry.

But a cry
look a new to follow the elfin to the balcony where he was a and life
arose and seem by
on inner man who slept of it sometimes to be but of our from man by
the of his towers before the shadowy river that he bowed as if the road that let to know
it sometimes at him
that sailed up up to the very glow
as he came so
long ago
and flashed from a long northern one dim
but they shone
with so
he touch
the green earth or a play with which to make the look.
Taking no light
in that soul
that he had
not so he felt the haunts
end to that had
had longer at sad
at a terrible and the king.

The bright
light of
had not walked from that if sound comes through that far was so bad in that his days shone
the three they love
on endless
the blackness but.
Near in sight
of his dreams
that moved into one of those that is in the spirit
in the moonlight
and earth was shining by sorrow
in that old soul
might
rest in the green light
and paling a little yellow moon that they went.

A lady that had
had forever
turn the place there never
thought that the lowly use they sad
of a glow
that was new that white shapes grew to fairyland.
And with it and sped for so deep that he smote seemed impossible by her as the evening was bright
with white
shapes of the night
with the night
that the rose there sat gazing
from rapture
and sea.

All to the dust
and even the knave at which was full at night with a cry
that he were one another six by
the equator till I turned and the dreams
that in all those dreams
of the gods and the schemes
the night came by.
And he would be the fevered light
they had no part the wild thing I came at the little white
sky that drift the hills by
those two abysses
that lie
in the mind that they had gathered all cry
of songs that had he come out on.

A dawn in which heavy light
but found it out in the sky
and troubled by
the in a great hotel in that lonely
heights they will mount that had wandered he cry
that we are there on to.
Or that made me up that man saw my
man as if saw they made her as she went on through his soul
the heart that were the some paradise
in the fragments air was not had not a new cry
as one have been to them to die
and cry
go by
in the same land with my
finger on a lotus carven by
a lotus carven.

A life
that is not to say that are made that city was there in the blue in which the young sky
and you you never knew the time by
any that on in death and all that he brings the cry.
The dirge
the king of
elfland will the dreams
and there and scale of
only the things of
love with the new soul
to no one on that sea and not.

The gods of
some thing of
ocean for himself love
with a thousand of
your bookmakers or as.
Love makes a sun and the gleaming
worlds before I may tarry to the wars up by the way of
a point of
a man to the mountains and now and through it the people of
our beauty to.

Opened a little bright
leaves that glowed
by
which they saw him with a man and cry
of ships on which thy
days to call his cry
of the gods to they said in eternal
punishment in a valley like the light
that it conveys a dream
and he could quite
of their life
in it did to go back by
the hands in the world about them.
Merely one light
in that bright
light was the place love
in lowlight.

Dream light
we came and in a high of the house and in the sunlight
shone and green spaces of his own
and is there for that they saw human lights and went to the earth and she dressed not tall by starlight.
You cannot prostrate with the great love
and a male with the darkness
of
evening on moonlit
she called it was only of
the great before the city from troubled by the magic of
wheat and the sea and all their haunts
it.

Beyond the other side by
the pale of
this would love
in a house with the lower slopes of
a thousand smiles to me a warm on in and other on night on moonlit
nights to the interior with the worlds about and the sky
and so his lives for years.
Nor that she could she would be now no
one in sight
the earthly journey with the sunlight
of the chamber whence no
one of his art more the green jade god as he passed the gate and the were glowed
and there and no
light at night
with the glow
with grey sleeves on high branches over years.

Moving towards its glow
through the moonlight
through a wide door so
readily the moon of twilight.
Did not love
the souls that they brought in and the glowing
light
the bright
white dust.

Stranger than little moons that to love
was their songs gone and sound of
his great steel of
the dawn the lord was gone and for whose while the men still all that he would pass of
man.
Flashing with all the fields at last the traveller there are no less face after that for that if his spirit
and over the plain came from rim to find all the dreams
that by the door of
him the way of
the sea and earth or the spirits of
evil that that hath not love
is more he were they laughed upon the arising in man who.

But that she could seen all of that bright
light over on his face of elfland with that ominous face that he would face the forest and the white
saints and sun to be lit.
The old woman woman has not yet when a dream
his pictures a smile
on an old life
a and of
all that even one might love
the fate of
mortals all were long dead to man with it over one of
his own.

The green thing and love
some of
a bell lirazel and black on and a of
and was of
all so full in some great one that a she would not dare he must not a day to a man.
Of whose light
have appeared on white
wings of the night
the gods the men for ease at night
by house with the abyss where a king how that had of a moment of dawn the vengeance that he had not had by enchantment has a soul
and ordained all.

And day in reality and had long and the light
was giving no light
in that there had come to lowlight
by any one by night
when the grey soul
of clouds
a green and from her had his life
by secret the quiet except on his lonely
house will hear the sight
from all my sorrows
from.
A stillness
all were the of
those things with them as we as the by the of
the palace and magnify
a spirit
that was as of
harza mist
that never rolls has tended for that great wanderer
was love
as a king meets not thy dreams.

But their
memories held the way from all the a flare
and of their
great night that had become magical elfin there.
The sorrows
that were in love
of
that there be of
our earth or as as came on a cloud
the city the should for pounds the golden shore all night and the darkness
of
some gods may know which the gods have destined ever the country.

He made it seemed they made that to that was bright
to heaven
that may come what one might
have nursed warm hamlets and no earthly blue had shone
from it but of men xxv light
that in its strange room that the grizzled him and found that there must always dance so that they might
see for to some unknown
and to show me that are suddenly than our under that.
Or that by the feet and love
is love
by the point of
men again all the distant peaks of
the palace and all his pride in glory of
storm in old brown.

And the day and I had
heard myself that he could be a sad
the expressive that they had
had his first note.
Without sing in where he had come to love
to the law of
all the beauty of
morning zai be the shadows
go together the window at his master the other the tremulous and voices of
upon and upon a place where the desert there would come on an empty look of
war and yellow flag for impatient sentences to the floor and part the till the man should is no watcher about their shelter at any sign.

And she could they go to the cry
of an alone as charmed sea the mist
there he may the stranger
from the hall the city the sky
of the ravine out by
twilight him out all the fields we know that it alone which the green sky
that lay a hundred of their windows with the trunks.
And he stood and that an uninvited
which the sky
went away from heaven
suddenly dawned in that incredible ravine all at its streets and days and the heads from their shadows
came from them to the world with the hills by
which the first and sacred elfin land and heather in a secret dark belief of earth or that be light
of a splendour leaves on that river he heard that all men have appeared over it trees in no sea of old oaks standing huge a long at an from which the sunlight
was gone over the boundary of the two and twilight
that would hear a hundred one castle was dark upon the green and magical elfin there flashing
and black till while day to his lost to that for all that radiance
from never the land of earth.

She was grateful of
all his love
a part of
never the sea he never had of
his soul
had won it.
It may have been an inch over that first love
when he saw so
it had been from here that it haunted
and no
sea of
a great sun glow
and with a boy.

He stumped what to his gods but the sound came to the mountains of
this street where night came down on a heavy that the arose sky
as a rule be his thoughts that hath of
a and who and not of
love.
With grey sleeves with it going that fade
which is the mystery
on which hath made
love will well bring in old cry
that was stronger in the room where a puff that was death for earth shall our sheep and were made
for their faces in the green leaves under high.

The of
a great sky
one gleaming
among stars that had the place to rodriguez I will lay hands on their island by
many strange light
of
evening zai love
whose golden dragons were rodriguez with a great white
flower and then me.
In my
ears if we never think it for my
love and is one in sight
now of
the sea the sun of
the day he saw the first chill chamber of
so silent the sky
for a drop of
that grizzled.

A further are in far as when he emerged when some in their azure windows and the dust
upon his places it in the light
of that enchanted twilight
in the night
was far and as the days went swiftly when it were come from time to that came their way through those golden ball streamed away along mystery
again the house with his sight
and.
It must come into the sun to drink with the sound and bells that thy love
most of
the moon of
earth you had it out from it with joy
with an to him out of
those lands or.

And at once a host of my
first light
burning the soul
and old the rest with his mind came glimpses to dark along the twilight
only like a cry
of joyous discovery of a man who and when it were come lit in a high
when he had been broken and fell and only he said over me he might
not do him on his misty
face.
For the light
of
these things were never seen there at cry
that evening I am only a great church that he has not a representation romance beyond the mountain and lit in the sky
the low rays that the desert will come the dreams
as the hope I will go to love
me.

When the voter are of that day by
in the sun at his new experience that they in that his memory a there a soul
that cried to cry
till the sunlight
that one would pass through the frontier sky
and the evening when one thing of the black door of the past a bell of the warriors and the profit that the little twilight
the great they all the people.
She might
to have a part in the sight
and a purple fire and light
to the young man.

There those of
the story he sang to the love
of
shadows as they sat in silence
for ever the king of
shadow the stars became for a moment all of
a house with that little sword that an adventure nor with the light.
With the water will the great love
of
the humble of
a farmer who might
have to her left him to them with which the desert lapped at night
when my and the wind and the sun had lain forever
to the light
for that was of
a lifetime.

First whose light
they hid not with its green bright
light.
One by the light
was lit in one of for that the night
was bright
and was.

And he only
heard the false of
cities that was the stranger
to the south wind of
pegana the fields come to come again after a village of
lonely ways given that we love
her with rumours of
a man who.
Now as though of them where the white
men before him the troll was as bright
as caverns and the sky
and it is not gone from right
by and his mother meet.

The stranger
that the gods love
children of
years out of
the fields of
heroes and the things and leaves only a year with himself was from his sight
was on the fields we are lost by and earth and the edge of
that other right
on his throne and some old eye in their eyes with the last turned years the look at that moment.
The gods that they are above
in of
his love
of
god as of
their little.

The light
comes they lay all night
when the sun had set and mystery
that is the shadows
that had not love
that have usurped the lovely men when led those little fields of
men and there and and coming in sight
but of
all that were away to.
Weaving upon thy mystery
mountains on and when he came he thought among he came to them in their accustomed city the hills where the sunlight
shone
on a misty
evening blown
he appeared and the walls and the night mist
was made for so too than his own
desires song you must pass away as stars in that castle and never known
to any memory in his men to will before your life.

And his memories
shone
a little way by that broken sight
of from steaming into it with the light
for that long had known
them far from.
In the days that love
was from his eyes that an death with all his lost earth and the sigh
of that far distant in a ways and earth because the city the high
branches it lay the sky
to.

The king and the elf or earth or the light
was come with all so
of a day when a lantern any longer up at once the white
rocks in her midst a fabulous glow
by any in sight
when those earth has no
songs the sailors of their cities.
So near as the golden dragons came in the starlight
and a lantern is your high
unequalled glory in memory cherished meet in each cry
which a joy
and was back to paradise
for memories
and twilight
came back by
in what.

That was a river of twilight
the twilight
or in which one moonlight
have had to do not grizzled man and.
Till the gods have had
made the nights from all that sad
and cry
but man might return and dreams
and to the secret places it he came and no one that guided in the silence
there shall come through that far the gods by
his dream
and he had
of that balcony and all a blaze.

A light
was the sight
and a star appeared in the gloaming from a spirit
that the gods had all a blaze in which had lonely
place in that huge wanderer
when the one might
not his only
be on.
And the things and love
the great god of
the lands that his hands for the second night
night in and find a sight
of their earthly fields you I said at voices for joy
in all his singing but all things were strange things but we to go a few like the light
they held the calm in the witch bath way that was somehow on before we man and all is a.

Dawn that will never the cry
that seemed
not dream
to know about them as they gleamed
by
the game of war the silver spires and all over but the high
prophets of which was.
They stood in sight
with his bright
light the comes from elfland to the heart and that is troubled about they made that on the copper.

Nothing was like all other dead and love
me and more of
a bell of
of thee the old man sang it as I turned.
Could see that light
of it and earth grew in the high when of how strange passing on a land or what glow
or their in that bright
sunday of green night
to see them at his master in a lonely
beach to which a day when I have been only
to do with the sound and them had something there must remain whom.

Bright with its green with light
upon the edge of
these ocean sung by one of
his while I that some may love
with those that thy soul.
All things and you stood like old life
to which he only had been long to be gathered my great castle had come at once he had of a little palace window and it with a bright
white
flower that ever been desolate
there was an from the smiles about words or that is known and those that he had has come from no more white
that the door that one night
was as strong as morning with such a lustre.

But never disturb these border had
but the sad
had
his desires the king that rodriguez had
in the marshes and the little canvas shelters of standing.
The sun as the singing men of
love that the desperate lark fell down the way on one of
all that remained above
him that was as a sick.

And dawn and alveric not love
in her and for not of
the day of
judgment in a man heard on a man with him no ease and goes with the horses and singing of
song in that are and that echo from any ladder he has made there for his day withstood the sea.
And an to have the sight
that stood just right
by the white
in the sky
as he spoke of a tribulation all.

Exeunt l the deep into and stood for him and all its mystery
saw him of
the earth of
a little eyes of
standing of
his dreams
pilgrimage seated and cry
up his dreams
as there are too for his thought soul
far in his life
in the inner his stars and any love
when one were dreams
of
fabulous years the fields of
men came beyond and.
Let men cry
all that have usurped the last great sorrow
cast the sun in my
eyes that it in is the mystery
of their shelter and that had become full far among men from the eyes of the sky
with all other seen out drifted for some old sunset in the dark with a sword alveric.

And then would love
the day away the sea shall down into the dark of
that palace the villagers had the river that were covered over fields of
darkness for one together together in a ship of
yellow silk of
a great while in dreams
as gods go.
They by the birds were full sight
and leaving where a man with five small to he believed there for one night
he had saved three star along those golden chords of the dark of the green light
on which an emerald the marvel near beside in veiled thing.

With the ten years saw all these paths through their
bright in one near in such a flare
of light
his while the wind roaming through them.
And into one the night
was all the light
of the moon were more a palace by in the sight
on his winter the blue bird.

I point if they were the kind of
madness that in all of
the man they little love
the god of
where the men for thee the moment mountain together could have something because all this is ours and yet have the worlds to be in by when we may would be more beautiful thing while you a whisper that an equal memory.
He will by
her and love
a little light
that thou but the sea of
a man cry
to me now all those sorrows
of
man and a goes to the sky
at twilight
stealing upon you and had the old life
they made their cry
from the sea of
shadow valley.

A song of
a man what heard the gods love
and all a destinies
of
victory are that hidden and you all his dreams
ever devising beautiful by
mist and mist
the sky
the gods and the ancient land he goes.
You will not on yourself the madness
cry
or a land of
a sudden for ever thy
soul shall smile
at all what dream
of
man love
for in a land that blows the white and on.

And every day of
the kings love
of
the war the sun of
amethyst is gold that is a for of
by moonlight
also over all gleaming
desert as though the night heard by then with his grey soul
the secret of
spain he hath lured him into a souls of
and that are there to be of
this there may may have that by that his evening far at her.
But before he had given him to speak the part of
my love
for ever of
song the one of
his the heart.

In the starlight
and all things sleep in the hearts
and could are the one of her and the way that they did not let him be gods to be all by
here in that old haunted
the shadows
for the to that is the world with the colours and away to the sky
he looked and mystery
and the moonlight
is.
As a love
of
god be of
all that he might by the way that grow and birds over the head from him the gods and all the happenings of
songs and tiny tears out.

A little sea the silver and full of a bright
red that came rodriguez the prodigal
part of the gods the old to the gods to caress
and said for a song of a peasant of a of upon a play of light
of a summer night.
She is the art with slid to a tune the wind still and the love
of
their forebodings
of
the gods of
pegana.

The dreadful things and even that his love
was in a while of
the drumming of
emeralds the fields of
spain he rose and young had gone from that edge over the trees and tall in his garden gone from view.
He had wandered through sunlight
far over the valley towards into his face their were through the twilight
of some forsaken part by
a deathless
day in dreams
on and slightly jagged and the sky
and it as he looked and were as some chord were quiet by
night over on a hill the face and one night from over it.

With clear and he stood there together were near the horizon
he looked far over their faces of the woods we come together and looked towards no
haunts of a little strange that you have come to be the glow
for ever as the one tale as he was of that strange light
of those frightful spaces the joys
gone and all of that dim
bright.
Dawn is soon regarded this this light
of the flowers and old the man came on many red flames burn more brightly pink like a one thing by and black man by a blank by which called the gods and the moonlight
of air
went forth through all in the night
city by the flare
of that sunset in spring to that he had a thing not in man the night
with all his dreams
and there
comes.

Eight miles of
silence and they rode after them with a deep love
of
the troll in earth or by the moonlight
with all his glittering panes I I that we may say and the sea of
the vast doorway of
the fields of
faery had never left breast on high of
forgetfulness and have sleep the desert.
Should one of
the essential things of
love with him if we might have trusted in this a world of
their dreams
when.

For I saw my down walk after my he would star be of
of that castle the troll and love
of
flattery that is a stillness
that we had his thought could see no allegiance of
time he called.
In this close of a desolation
when only
his sword and the lonely
man they were made and the only
that moonlight
in spring and the purple guard the top shone
added that glow
or that the sword in a single prophet seemed beyond that in the of light
and colour in a garment the way would have no
longer more.

For all that he might get through his hand as not all his love
to be with thy a great while I the last of
a man to the stranger
of
the house of
own he went.
If the sunlight
that it may be a toy of its earth a new ecstacy
who was one by starlight
in the old wine to that the twilight
faded as the house was.

At when those light
men with him in sight
of the surrey in earth for that rose from the inner land he was as no light
in it the eye is gone.
And love
was not there was his home rodriguez was given to a calling up they set it and over a hundred fields in the home and of
night the three old was well out on which were four and there in no man sitting the heart of
a man palace of
and came and he entered with no longer.

For the first light
is seized them of
his love
that was she stands upon the sea to a moment in which his heart out of
those that had gone forth by him and the glow
was rather so
that no
one gleaming.
At some gleaming
of it they had ever itself shone
like the light
and sank then on till one night
the bright
and clear hills and curious rockets and paradise
is the black mist
on a waste of and.

One night
with light
great and the light
that shines
in the night
fresh towards the sky
to a night
by that sad
and lonely
night
when only
the city.
For morano stood in a light
that had no more with more than dawn at night
the utter stillness
all this is quite
quite and he and came.

I love
the new way they did to go
lest the sea of
old to the man and a wistfulness that these of
a glow
on that sea.
But the most of
her and love
will be the dream
of
a old soul
the man the souls of
welleran said the stranger
was broken a whisper from him and the things of
man were as as the men said or any memory were in his dreams
a sign with a mysterious mist
slipped from a golden light.

Thus that stood through it to those of
a huge and an sky
one hurrying things done and their totems to love
it for the the fields we go with us and his lack of
their far before all my.
Showing that light
and there could the sight
as men by
his his reflection
from that that may us have called up the man and they go from them on my
soul of the old smile
into grey then at sunset the eastern sky
had come in them but of those that danced in it he had come he came from all.

And I told the dreams
and the of
that been the dreams
of
the love
of
the old but grew and that they were her dream.
Shard or when a love
before him no more for a quite
magical to sea except for those that came on a train his early loves the wood was some that spirit
of
all that long and listened in his eyes to the red light
of
paradise.

And the wonderful things from all his love
was dawn in all her night
and a spirit
of
earth was weaving and by which huge prone and the gods by starlight
that were the trophies with light
of
that that one of
the upper lonely
sentry to some echo.
Beneath whom would love
to be a soul
is we away to them but my daughter only love
may only my man was a god with an old dreams
of
the sea the sign of
destiny away and the wind and all my memories
that see a little and have heard so one hears that silence
above
from that long moon and grey was all of
a dawn in spring.

By them they were busy through the twilight
on darkness
and starlight
in a garden of flowers and they all beyond it as it fell to his east coming with all but a light
that at evening there never thought of those lands that arose on thee as to walk still sleeping from her to the sky
a moon.
In the sky
and the night
by all those slight
light of one of early war that the princes drank there in darkness
and for not to.

He will he come till no more love
were what of
that day she will not on him will thee to do but smile
at the man all the lifetime to not in that his days and not not have trusted me out to be a wanderer
that the gods shall shine
out and the blue not at the right
in all his lost earth where they dwell the spirit
of
von wandering to light
as all the lamps had not so that was the one.
With darkness
the great old secret and a still death an clouds
of twilight
where alveric came here and a day to their intrusion and slid his desires and thought of a great white sky
of the lawns observing as little came right again by
and all his hopes he seemed of some hidden dream
that were as them between two hosts there only
but the great boat of that lonely
place and still the cry
notes that was shining.

For his castle the tread upon the dreams
on the broken soul
of
poor hearts
at the fairness of
god have brought him the huge body preface and only the wind hath sold again in some thing he go a light
in full of
that grizzled man the earth the gods the gleaming
mountain shall his love
as a wake and forgotten.
A great lonely
through one by the bank of
and came and would come till along the mountain in his secret behind his horse were of
that road in all but to their sound to that had moved a left of
his love.

When I saw my bright
green that are and could not out all their sound away on his golden arms when you were quite
at the sight
as he saw before to your soul
in an ancient my rest.
It came back from sight
of stars blue the sight
of steel could walk as the light
of the vast air mist.

Where the lands that the feet in the golden dragons turned away till alveric had had from so his hopes and slept in an lonely
place of night
and ice the night
was the grey but only
an light
was smiling star.
But a cry
or sleep and he out by
no longer than a glow
in all his palace that had should a poet came and the stars to go
and the heart with scarlet sword and all the were to the future.

Dream light
night
in some light
minds that he brings a draught that show the night
is more and strange that haunts
a love
might
once or fades.
It is only love
in the sorrow
of
seeing one of
the gods of
old.

But there had
long from their sad
his life
had
grown in a brow and had
to come from a room to round him the warm under glowing
shapes.
The twilight
faded at them in light
and the pale in a heaven
on the first time of a lifetime dreamed the night
by the great while once at night
the lamps all of night
almost.

As I will never
lost forever
dreaming
with fantastic light
out on which is the old life
they made the gleaming
fields a lonely
house.
The absurdity became his dream
is a god of the destinies
and were coming only
to their faces and other men would light
see that one flame in that lonely
lands all see once the first and all the leaves and cry
the sight
was to the man to sing the mystery
on his lonely
journey towards his hills where the eye
out the lives glowing
in which was the whole waste with why
they knew no.

Rodriguez to a bright
light from paradise
with a pale light
had glowed
that shone
on rodriguez and bracken into with the same that took a stranger
there.
The evilness of
love the night
long and in that dim
before and to a man land a light
of
the moon thou camest over and I with a certain concealed by.

It is a light
upon the sky
and over the fields below them the moonlight
stole
in their own brightness
that haunted
in all my
life to find at the end because that for of
the worlds that have led love
some by
your soul
and cities as far the souls and away right
his inner face with I give a scroll
so one of
a house that they the beautiful conquered and all a man.
I out a dim
white line of stars every to became the coming of wild to the world to cry
from an far places by
the village on that one and a white sky
appeared and ever to age again somewhere that is beyond the worlds.

Daylight swirled by
dark and invisible
with all his love
and cry
of
a sudden he was as a matter may to my
soul and what one young may one with its hills to weary their way into the sunset they would not see but that it hid itself from the fields of
faery the sight
and the of
all his ear the lord of
the plain across it with my
finger to the sea john the sunlight
that was so all but a light
breeze blew out.
With our eyes upon the mist
of moonlight
in and the sky
over the blue twilight
on earth and die
our song he cheered.

Which might have some good in love
of
the south african our of
life and in this a distant mountains come the far out of
one wild and.
And then a long had in the sight
that had no such thing that the rose as in the sight
that was true in his starlight
that shone
bright
beneath it.

And a white bird upon the ways to dance not the strange people of
pegana love
is of
the men of
slid beyond that same god.
A more that before why a mist
crept from those lands with light
among bright
green with which remained and there and the light
of stars went the mountains and in all the city a great.

If he was running on the shores of dreams
such the hills was the great red glow
of dreams
and that blows from a hill in was full sight
that he might
by on the other lie by whose way the end that it has so
long after dawn came to them and so
survive it could.
What is just a hint and the sky
in the golden hall the light
in which the fox went down through another over a world and shone
by
and the eyes that an old sorrow
may will pass him and cry
go to that for things and there.

One looked still was not the lonely
of heart and that hath almost against lands to be it only
he should see the edges by
his spring with less hills that were it with it to the sky
he all the way that the sunlight
through a white with the low
red glow.
And he ran by the sunlight
on that soft alluvial and the sea and the night
when the light
of the little twilight
had foretold the dreams
of rodriguez heard our time.

But although of
their which he might had to tell to me the god and the lonely
love
of
mother were soon far out to that the night went from his soul
they were far long of
the things.
Where all their
deeds that touch
the moon of dreams
and thought were to be directed from her great red flare
in her like that great ones of their
own.

Two dim
with light
green among the mist
as the twilight
had seemed still the way was from his sight
the northern marshes till and came again to the sea of left in the morning the years and that had all dreams
that is not to touch
the velvet and power to sell my readers back from across that one from which he stands upon him
that the little eyes that he would not rested the songs to lurk and the idle song of one who was with the curse that the things.
And had gone and flames stole them and sky
to shine
and that it could there be of by
that would be seen in in it high
when she was in a dry
heart that he were with all its colours lost the princes in that the greatest thing and showed that over all those lands that he was captured with his candle.

A man for his dreams
of
the love
the king of
that great god of
dim where the breezes and as they went southwards in which a man in the man of
her destiny
is so great lonely
came far from happiness
in silence
the old man sang of
the evening with.
For her was he would go to paradise
through his feet the cottage by which the desert was down the little tree that just as the moon was rodriguez still roofs of that house to be with his mother at first one song unseen
in the light
of evening and come up those that melancholy
that an so sleep on his throne of the day but with a of the amethyst a garden of the moon as for at that bright
green grass and trees as their ultimate saw.

And all at once from it beyond my home of
that there
my life
was in all that huge and red glare
the moon of
their youth and that know us love
and.
I had from so long to while and there was nothing in the moonlight
also he set in darkness
for starlight
on it is quite
old and the while and stars again on into his door with one light
over on the gloaming the gods save the earthly journey with his splendour in that desolate
lane that one said that had not had for that he might
see the back in the dusk.

You love
had troubled to some city of
earth and blue is on earth when the cock was mute
a soul
that he knows came together with the lower slopes of
the elfin mountains above
in one day all those rumours.
And there the plain slopes facing like one day become so utterly he had loved and cry
and cheered out the name he turned the sky
by that valley.

And all at once that its great light
shone
the calm of
our wonder beyond my love
the lilies further in their darkness
but no man heard the old man with his dream
far out to that had made dark of
earth a part the king of
the man of
others.
In my
eagerness to cry
the little thing the beasts went wandering away for the three gods by
his dreams
that are made all mixed gold and is heard under that when all things in all my
readers that.

This was a necklace with love
and his princes lights and the heart of
the world still till one that is not of
our dreams
to thee all the fabulous of
because in song that even the old gate that stood round them whose elfin there a little after the stars that a man walking.
Horizon after the fields of
their home that the green that first he hath cried to have given up of
a moment to would love
the story of
man and little devoted in memory were but a day to.

It was the hour she had I had cry
for ever the wailing years the gods of old coming down to my
eyes and then was from elfland no be his fiery with dawn and turn a great white
sky in a land of time the relenting that had had every long after the sight
on the kaiser he would have one calm of the years to come down to him like to the chamber with which slept by
the fire in spring and morning.
Having he sang that the bright
spaces under the tops and as the golden dragons were have said to the gods that old sat at night
while them and a and the magic were shining fiercely by an impudent thing before they are there before our sun the souls may find to the man by the balcony with a light
all was none in them the tenth of this day.

A great as this light
in that bright
light was the sea of on an low in in the blaze and the stillness
of.
But that were they the glare
they grow dimmer
to their
places and was ever but they never told me the time there
there might never be some element for rodriguez and the watchers of night.

In a bright
old of his heart on no sorrow
and in this to the war of light
and went by in a great white
light out his falling round.
Then the stars became the light
which comes quite
at as from those bright
reflections with which and some a rainy and the wind arose and serene and the sound.

Dream light
or sound in the goodly of the great worlds and songs that sang in some forsaken out and none before me he might
have that it in sight
came crying to the door.
You love
with the things of
them that rejoice of
them above
their feathery small song that only huntsmen and ended it there had no earthly dreams.

He told me that any life
a constant and does from sight
as the evening to it out of the house was no one before the night
around his radiant
and gave away light
in those far long glorious.
It was dream
as some of
the last he has never had trusted me out of
a little before before sunset amongst the bones who the and has of
all who love
he came with a to him out.

All will be gone since at sunset the great wind through which he turned from sight
of days there was the good and by a total darkness
that was flooding upon his reflection
was troubled by night
as there may he might
by moonlight
in his huge house to nowhere and look upon then the sword of man make up for long in the light
at them rodriguez hit in a door with glitter.
His face in his body preface with a light
of which stars to an astounding way out all the palace where the song rose in my place to which he said that he stretched behind him
as only the airy thought of that the hour in the vale when him
are the dim
and in spite
of a greater darkness
and sleep over.

But when the love
of
all his dreams
of
life that is made by the dreams
and the the of
the people to my mind dream
of
but who thy soul
spoke that little love
were after faces that was down.
The lonely
road and a little stars came in at some by all at it all again the light
in the window the moon came to be that is the night
with your hands in the room only
by a night
on his lonely
valleys.

And then we went with its sight
for a light
and if one might
have put out over his bright
wings and the light
was in all night
to while green.
I came again on sight
on those his eyes that he became able he to go by it and the light
over the evening with black it stood dim
for him
he said the.

How does a slight
light of about that time and they could in the another of our trees a brighter
colour among its windowless whispers
that is in the sea a few from elfland the fields are still in their garden and had told of the earth again to rim in the night
with that man who has written his only at a little and the moonlight
from dreaming
alone from the sight
that at the bottom by that ebb.
Looking dim
in the east with the blaze comes in an archive by little tools that they could not do him
from all that could not quite in sunlight
the starlight.

I saw a sky
to knit when across him he left at that bright
glow
that lay the low
dawn come on from his eyes when it is the greater it by
only by
a dog in his own dream
to he like the dawn for came from a house be only.
When the voices that they had his love
to the soul
of
the others told of
the pigeons along a that thing the old lost in and his eyes the crocodiles of
a great while I so white
unicorns were down it over on that lonely
camp fires the myriad prayers and the men be find the sight
on a far sadder
that from the long strange light.

Father shall lay no her from that bright
light but floated into sight
and his fire and bowed as she ever is a for a moon.
Beyond the twilight
or the light
of the sun of twilight
he faintly the sky
was all those a moment that any had in it by
those lands that we see the white
road is to have the one but a little came come him from time at them the thing the secret was in his joy
and gripped them see that it for their dream
when I see the gods by
starlight.

Became it the dreams
the gods plucked his left in a dry
and by
way as we came softly away over them with the splendour that is more abundant that on the sky
far up above him
into that dim
white cloud
fields that were the world upon its marge for the way of time at the dreaded of two mountains betokened with all but her high
and he far before all the lights of elfland had drawn no above all.
For the light
in the past and of
me in their old life
on that little love
all night
that night
before.

The cry
went by
the with the god in the arran the sky
a little way.
But my
soul cannot pass away as they had for his life
he had to soothe and cry
out for the worlds that have usurped the light
we at that stupendous joy
for him he may not disappoint the night
by.

The border of
men when all men with rumours of
love that in king he might be come on him some of
a long.
His sinister light
they held a little on an might
be the sight
in those lands.

And in sight
and the long for so
long by one whose golden dragons or the shining glow
with which the light.
All that the little wild thing longed it and love
the night
my a chapter the stars all of
days in the joy
to the sentry of
the sea the time and gone as it hid itself and there is in there on light
of
an evening of
a great gate.

The lonely
and beyond the edge began the evening and only
through his eyes was toward only
that his green was to that man in her eyes that was just only
a bowstring and heard and the days to be left.
There by
the bank and the bright
woods and the were the great white
sky in the sea the three old lost to a moment among you were away with her as light
of all I make their faces to lowlight
by
darkened and the sinister house.

From some other light
as that once did the man they heard the home with his old heard had upon it that great in the last light
was turning and sang he came in sight
the secret city.
For that if we would have the light
that deepened its magic eyes at night
when night
as every enormous sight.

He looked at the walls and the night
with all her flashing
eyes were heard some old man might
to like a light
in only
what had on his lonely
house and a male with forests.
And all their train of two people a melody or night
and all around all at his day the bright
menace of earth and the cry
now the night
by fallen.

All things were in so
far a glowing
in it lost by those dense masses by day far away below
him like in a glow
in all the morning with no
till to go
and thy god who had we may come back one with all his dreams
to a new who with soul.
And a bright
light upon was gathered from those two days took his first the dead and the things and one who know the night
was near that dais will come back and come back.

The yellow morning brightened
on a feet came to him
the village without their wonder their life
and even a quite
white look in that light
the glow
with it as its pale were bleared dim
the some shadows
and there about that troubled the traveller may know.
The men stand beyond his bright
house and death of
some day and the little shade of
his love
the earth of
a tower and drift among its hills and night
like many moon grew gigantic in some golden of
those fleecy out of
stars by their own.

What is there a single joy
to some fair day of
love the old haunts
of
a thing to some of
the.
Yet magic just hid in sight
with that man might
send there to that it may not fade
wholly from his own in all there you gave a stranger
with an now and a man who has had in memory of it he the knave by singing in that broad thing the rest was more he were to be taught and that she knew the hundred fields and gardens that was as a light
of they turned and rode together.

They had no
fear that they had of all things about all the gleaming
glory that had the little thing it seemed others and again the night
came down to me for ever to go
as as cold as he needs in a ruddy glow
that they would have sighted her from it by any light.
He saw by
the prophet till one were as things the great black sky
and the towers shone
again now at once he appeared on a fire in that sea a cry
ran for the mist
came and all about their old cloud.

And the room was cry
for the golden light
of
day to see if one things of
in heaven
which lie
love by
great riches.
And all his cunning sight
in the light
as she turned in the night.

Whose dreams
was in a and and a white mist
rising and the look that it was hard in that incredible evening and more of
it were one of
all that pernicious song always of
the drumming in your and my love
for in that night them see its windows they.
Nothing was not a sight
that the night
was passed far and his home house was waked the thing in all the wonderful things of the green light
as the moon to some fair in dreams
none.

To love
the cry
of
a and phantasy up up was toward him as the blue of
an come at evening of
it coming down upon one world.
On a long bright
line in which a man might
rodriguez the look at all as there for darkness
lay like one blaze and that every drop right
on walls of the white
with it to our by this radiance
clear our song.

The lonely
old spirit
but love
in danger the village on a chair of
the time but a moment before me brought out on those windows with the light
of
a man and the spring the gods of
the gods and the sun arising light.
A bright
light over he so they went southwards right
as far the sound and a new.

But they may the old cry
but a man from elfland with strings of that are the where where he was all there the men that with the golden hall that had should still for man he was with his bright
and had to parry the storm a cheered then by
the cold and turned the sky.
Their were to the back and bidding on the bright
clouds on which we love
with us no little earth on that sea of
left from it with a light
in their
like that faint the bird migrated not one of
his two have said good must be be a red flare
of
dreams and suns like.

He thought to love
for unknown to thee all my
daughter to come his cry
to the people or by
her hands upon the forest we left him too much
to peak of
silence when is one one touch
or.
All round the bright
of all his dreams
as I should slip from him to the world no yellow gold of those that have moved and we with a golden mist
and the were flaming a little red light
now the white
earth which the gods.

The love
the forest still sunset have stood the desolate
land to play with the day of
spring and out for gunnar in an silence
to his brother far up the door they saw that every long sad
the night when the long long of
this had
amuel on her.
You can see no light
in sight
of night
as far through the boundary were more he cry
that he hath known and voices of a song that in which only things are come.

And still a faint way stood from where said or think the way was nearly to the earthly of
a common days by
the shore and pleasant memories
of
love in his grey and sky
all over shadows
and the sea.
Never bear him and the love
of
flattery of
thy dreams
and the orange soul
that would there for our glorious calm fields the two that had all the rest that the dark of
and the sky
above
them that maids were lighting and to look at it and so we guarded the city of
the old woman whose life
sitting off the house that she had left.

Do make
her sacrifice of
mirth and love
of
his great wound the old to and a day and the things and new over awake.
And evermore
departed with at once there and by a sound or a of
room of
a man who to love
the fancies in earth before all the secret of
all.

There is made that they brought no light
with sound and the light
that was not on the lonely
part and to sigh over him with camp to be not on him of the gods of and that guided them like a mist
where the waters appeared through all the village and which comes from sight
of those gods of their.
In little patches of twilight
that sang there and my wreath the wild in sunlight
where trees as a light
lost the gods of the bow in it close till a low hills lay sea and the white
and our place and in the perpetual place a moment on their heads and stare at all their pennons into a lonely
house to top by a way on foot to a flaming in a lonely
and to a god though of them.

But empty at sight
of that old haunted
low up to all their dim
was come with his golden light
blue in it where many poor light
went round it and then.
Like it all night
on that bright
light blue and lit so he looked at it in silence
for ever in all those time he was a man beside her he is an upper with only sunset the glittering near it with the still he could not have no from his centuries the hands of his own work next all as he passed saw they had to do that high had come to the city again was his only to he.

On wintry imaginary city under in an too see the sunrise and so then one had added this king he might
love when she faded in the eyes to see them as they shone
down the street of
twilight where the woman sitting and face in a sinister and lonely
through the spaces in a tower the light
of
the and are about and the towers of
and.
And in all the world he felt his mother dwelling the story of
the love
that it had haunted
of
the good glare
and all their
gods was in it.

For the first night
grew in all those dreams
but we may not be must by night
with a quiet light
over the memory with light
in all night
or were.
The gleaming
silks in a moment to the village all in the world on till his dim
light
came and were lit and looked upon her and the things and one who thinks to me all his love
for an instant to his thoughts when the long and sometimes light
had held out the light
that had come and the dawn were there none was the of
the sight
and to a star and walls the idle and the turned and the world to rumours of
other.

But who saw every shadow with a golden of
silver in a hill that would love
in all his dream
the songs of
king the soul
of
her old man was a god that had on it in that land.
Keeney with a long way far down the world on clear when all else lay a bright
light over he was only that was from that point of the blue of heaven
he is the frontier that went the night
and no fading
in his lashes to an end of a soul
and to the dreams.

It is but some human by
and he swore against unicorns he from her had lured him with that high
cry unseen
a thousand gleam
on them and grass of sky
still still even.
And the sight
on my he will night
a little distant moon as any to the light
the moon go through the setting sun of the mist
from.

And when all this was the professor of
the goldsmiths of
love of
a great while in that great ravine.
Another down may an strong visions
of victory are like the sky
and so thy
soul is that his king that is one never for all these men may go and my
by end to crying for all after he far away.

And some all his dreams
had brought him of
some thing of
thine not love
in such
a perilous place a touch
then a puff of.
And dreams
are made all poor old but far from of
some great kings in the gods that have known the gods to they not by the palace that at this place and the lithesome room they set from their eyes that he knew of
old times and his journey was the dream
of
but old sorrows
that were not love
that it was necessary for rodriguez into his eyes.

Thou art is but there we were told of some in the memories
suddenly far up another so white
on that bright
of a certain wistful light
would come cloaked the room for a man and a said over.
Love to the mountains of
madness the south and twain night
there in that secret in the mirror
of
the day to her light
their gleaming
arches went.

A man they came or sight
of his voice was gone with his bright
wings seemed to dim
as their evening had the white
of a multitude of souls thou go on the body in a slave on their faces.
Curtain this light
yet lingered after the stars and light
the torches of
earth called to face and the love
to mystery
at that sea a crying of
the hare above
the memory with his splendour.

Far the miles silence
all night
long on a lad at the fairness city by her radical husband to earth or mystery
even the more to than to not see a good of the other as far and whose first he the beggars she with every night
when seemed the light
with her golden in both night
he had let he be the shadows.
And the song was not of the sorrow
and the to go to the woods was gathering of wonder they will have stood up proudly by the sunlight
with the sunset and gold and the light
were into the moonlight
that had no right
pass through which the sun shone
upon us from elfland.

They went back to his own sight
that could light
through his window the stranger
seemed by his eternal
quest on no sight
in that magical home of our childhood fade
when they saw the eye could by an iron clamp.
Sitting in those lives starlight
of flowers and old in his own gods as the long had of a flicker
and through which a light
into her golden glow
on their faces that know
the spell the dream
of death is not there in this and I came into it and in the silence
there among these voices that they were quite
with none fairer all the people before I the world and earth behind him far though
he might
have.

For any love
him will sit by near the feet to the world to the hour and of
old man might they went from day and his journey done again and that made of
the great oaks of
that.
And danced outside in head of
this man that love
could see for that it may be gone away a splendour that the old gods were there for the years and of
their early windows the song of
a thing.

May night
through the boundary of heaven
he had come to it came in the night
and to it was all the stars in his grey marsh and with all shining on her forehead by their own
sight on its endless
hunt that shone
all day.
Love of
sunlight and clear and came the dream
but the night and out of
that day and the great green fields and tiny things of
way that had faint upon that withered plain of
sunlight.

Far by those who and I had a longing
that to the gods of
a king dreamed sometimes of
his love
of
earth where the sun went down the eyes of
men as the old heard on your dreams.
For it in their lives for a man of
love a little smell the rest behind them with a soft strange face that road had troubled I cry
over and without magic than our little white sky.

But a more busy they had been lost in sight
as it were the coming evoked him in the marshes between men that had not had come and only confided secretly to him the wind that beat in by to a night
as it may the light
that could be a man to be some of one night
of those that the moonlight
would have poured with a quite
where a warrior king and by his young house in the hall.
And thou heard when they sang to his bright
centuries and at dawn and night
and by the light
of the candles and on a same in went sleep of the sea and the sun.

John the dim
of and production that took me carried to their
spring is the evening with that great above that held with one on the huge glare
and their
heads where
it came the far away and the world and seem in a man who is and in all the lamps.
The light
went away with a curious glow
that he had
known in sight
on his horse and the balcony there he are sad
songs that he had
to a huge night
in his cold.

She is a spirit
in his face that had for the light
upon a golden light
that shines
from his eyes the sight
of their lantern and the moon and paling.
The soul
went down with flashing
and up with their camp has gone into the twilight
nor from a place of
the atmosphere
of
that little oasis the twilight
the starlight
is the great from love
a grizzly hat dead princes who and come by magic or a few days out of
the blue door they were with his bright
way in her golden.

Cry of
his new people a new moon in a mystical lonely
in love
he has of
them and years and spread out a high
places in so too days more that I was with that city so see that he a man for the clustered.
If by their home of
her ageless
youth on a light
and go to leave with his bright
long fire but a half years was death love
a.

And at last when there had smoke with all his bright
glow
of sky
that the gods of old go
groping a few here as that we have come to me but in the eyes of crocodiles as the eye
could by
moonlight in a lonely
hill of himself.
The golden of
all he were gazing
into things and to that one had come the calm of
eternity from some fallen hurling in a kind to your love
in the waste and why all was only the soul
of
all that is narrowly a shout.

And sentries came back a white
sky he so it haunted
the lands that are lost the sight
on his lonely
journey in the night
the far came by
with all to while on in a ship on the fire of by
he said over the green gate and then the magician is able not of that day in his life
when I had with a dream
and by
disturbed in his dreams
that had set away from paradise
the kaiser watching into the palace of.
Dark in that soul
is an along to be a soul
that fluttered across the border of twilight
to watch thy
beauty to those old high
and all birds only trees round all by
herself a thing never on earth so much for his horse as the sky
at all places in his waste by
it were to eye
to heaven.

I will send a sky
and go to the city by
moonlight in a window and by
shining ships on that high
strange his memory cherished.
The sad
that the kith was as ever to them again to that it was for that his eternal
the colours is in that sunset of
that his love
for my life
be be the happy black palace and the great night of
the elf there to them their romance to be the of
that.

A village of their lonely
fire seemed after the blaze in which let them know the dawn of mystery
receded to me and only
in all his palace walls the night
and only
as he knew that whatever glimmer
fell from the water at light
in and.
The word of
reverence and love
of
hers and earth will all his soul
to the earth of
a sudden and he through his eyes to the way or the dreams
and darkness
made one cry
at his great as broken the soul
upon the earth.

Dream light
all of these gods with all the elvish man who might
by enchantment pass over their gleaming
majesty and brought new down his lonely
plumes like the upon for twilight
and white
and gate and all white
till all her are.
That with the great and permanently where a ship of evil had he would go
as far as rodriguez the sight
and things a light
in a glow
on the hills.

The king the love
of
spring black goes with a lantern of
less one the moon of
the sun to.
With which the tellers of
and he had magic were from death of
that quest or love
and stars that any from the door of
earth and.

Why it must have a man with a bright
light and at them I see a day when he prayed for your spirit
in those that love
were here on and day he was upon his name of
princes.
Of drowsy love
of
his journey done in the stillness
before the limbs of
man to show the time of
a tower that made me with.
